This repository is a monorepo that we manage using [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/). That means that we publish several packages to npm from the same codebase, including:

[`gamut`: Our React UI component library](/packages/gamut/README.md)

[`gamut-styles`: Utility styles for gamut components and codecademy apps](/packages/gamut-styles/README.md)

[`gamut-icons`: SVG Icons for gamut components and codecademy apps](/packages/gamut-icons/README.md)

[`styleguide`: Styleguide Documentation & storybook development sandbox](/packages/styleguide/README.md)

## Local development

1.  Run `yarn` in the root directory
1.  Run `yarn build-all` (certain packages like `gamut-icons` need to be built to function in storybook)

### Running the storybook styleguide

1.  Run `yarn start` to start the storybook server
1.  Add new stories to `packages/styleguide/stories`
1.  Stories are written using storybook's [Component Story Format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/)

### Publishing Modules

1.  Make your changes in a feature branch, and get another engineer to review your code
1.  After you've reviewed and tested your code, you can merge your branch into master.
1.  To merge your changes, use the "squash and merge" button in github. Make sure you update the title/description of the merge to match the [commit message guide](#commit-message-guide), otherwise it will not generate a detailed changelog entry.
1.  Once your branch is merged into master, it will be published automatically by CircleCI.
1.  You can check the master branch or CircleCI for the new version number

### Publishing an alpha version of a module

Every PR that changes files in a package publishes alpha releases that you can use to test your changes across applications

1.  Create a PR
1.  In the github "checks" UI, find the "Publish Alpha" task
1.  Once this check has passed, click on it, and look through the output for the alpha version number
1.  Use this version in the other application you want to test your changes on

### PR Title Guide

Your PR Title should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) Format.

Because we use squash merges through the Github UI, you'll need to format your PR title to match these guidelines. Your individual commits will affect the `alpha` version number, but not the final version once you merge to master.

This Title format will be linted in the `probot/conventional-pr-title` status check and prevent merging if you do not follow the correct format.

### PR Title Format

When you click squash and merge, the title should follow this format:

```
type(scope): message
```

Examples:

```
fix: fixes a bug in some component
```

```
test: adds test to component
```

With a scope:

```
feat(Button): :sparkles: An awesome feature for the Button component
```

Breaking change:

```
feat(Button)!: :fire: Deleted the Button component
```

Check out the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) page for more detailed options

Here's an example of how the squash and merge form should look:

**Type**

The `type` determines what kind of version bump is needed. A `fix` will create a `patch` release, while a `feat` will create a `minor` release. Major releases are only created when the text `BREAKING CHANGE:` is included in the `Body` or `Footer` of the commit message.

`type` must be one of the following options:

Standard types:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

**Scope**

A scope is optional and consists of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., feat(Button):

**Breaking Changes**

Adding an exclamation point after your type, before the colon, will indicate that your PR contains a breaking change, and increment the major version number of the modules you changed.

Examples:

`feat!: made a breaking change in the Button component`

`feat(Button)!: made a breaking change in the Button component`

You should do this if your changes introduce any incompatibilities with previous versions of the module.

This will indicate to package consumers that they need to refactor their usage of the module to upgrade.

**Body**

Optional extra description for your changes.

This goes in the description field of the squash and merge form.

Make sure to clean up the default content if your listed commit messages are not adequate to describe your changes.

If you include the text `BREAKING CHANGE:` in your description it will trigger a major version bump. We prefer to use the `feat!:` syntax for breaking changes described above.

### Publishing the storybook

1.  Storybook is built and published automatically when there are merges into the master branch
