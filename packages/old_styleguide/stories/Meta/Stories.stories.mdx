import title from '@codecademy/macros/lib/title.macro';
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';

<Meta
  title={title}
  parameters={{
    subtitle: `We're still building these opinions out, so don't expect all stories to adhere just yet!
`,
  }}
/>

## Quick start

We've provided a few helpful vscode snippets to help you get through boilerplate. To use these start to type these strings in your editor and pick the template and fill out the tab targets.

- `component-story`: The default story template.
- `toc-story`: A index page template with a table of contents.
- `canvas-block`: A simple template for a more granular story.

## File structure and naming

When you make a new story theres a few things to keep in mind:

- The folder structure is indicative of our flavor of atomic design.
- The folder struture is identical to the storybook hierarchy generated.

First find the right folder for your story in `packages/styleguide/stories` (e.g. `Atoms` | `Molecules` | `Organisms`).
Once you've found it create a new file `#{COMPONENT_NAME}.stories.mdx` (if you need an adjacent file to store variables create a folder of the component name and create an `index.stories.mdx` inside of it).

In your new file you can use the above snippets to set up your component or add:

```tsx
import title from '@codecademy/macros/lib/title.macro';
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';

<Meta title={title} />;
```

Your new story will be generated with the correct hierarchy and added to storybook!

## Story structure

In our fledgling collective opinion, a good component story page consists of:

1. **General Information** Each component should define some key information on the `<Meta />` component
2. **Flagship Story + Props** A single default story showing the default state of the component with a connected props table right below it.
3. **Variation Storiees** Granular subsections that show the discrete varaitions of the component and describe their use cases

### General information

1. `subtitle`: What the component does, and what the component would typically be used for.
2. `source`: The source package of the component (e.g. `gamut` | `gamut-styles`)
3. `status`: The health of the components API (e.g. `current` | `updating` | `deprecated` | `static`)
4. `figmaId`: The id of the figma file that is associated with the design (e.g. `ReGfRNillGABAj5SlITalN`)

```tsx
<Meta
  title={title}
  component={MyComponent}
  parameters={{
    subtitle: 'A standard button component to use for most UI elements'
    source: 'gamut',
    status: 'current',
    design: {
    type: 'figma',
    url: 'https://www.figma.com/file/ReGfRNillGABAj5SlITalN',
  }
  }}
/>
```

### Flagship story

The first story for a component should be intended to give the reader a broad overview of its high-level functionality.
Try to include the major behaviors for the component that most readers would need to understand its uses.

Give this story the same name as its component in pascal case.

```tsx
<Canvas>
  <Story name="MyComponent">
    {(args) => <MyComponent {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


<PropsTable
  story="MyComponent" // the name of the flagship story
/>
```

### Granular stories

Each subsequent story should elaborate on an important behavioral feature of the component.
Try to show a single use of the behavior configurable with args.

```tsx
<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="My Variation" // a human readable name for the variation of the component
    args={{ prop: true }} // overrides of the args defined on <Meta /> to produce your desired state
  >
    {(args) => <MyComponent {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
```
