<strong>The design system for Codecademy <span aria-label="sparkles" role="img">✨</span></strong>

Gamut components, styles, and utilities are the core of the Codecademy brand shared across its websites.
They're most notably used on <a href="https://codecademy.com">codecademy.com</a> but are also found on our internal websites and tools, as well as on our mobile application.

This storybook represents components found in the Codecademy [Client Modules](https://github.com/Codecademy/client-modules) repo.
Its organization adheres to <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a>.

  <AboutCell

    kind="Atoms"
  >
    Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. 
    They are the most granular, low-level building blocks in our system.

    examples={["Banner", "Card", "Interstitial", "Tabs"]}
    kind="Molecules"
  >
    Molecules are groups of atoms together.
    These consist of a few atoms combined for a small, self-contained design.

  <AboutCell

    kind="Organisms"
  >
    Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively
    complex, distinct section of an interface.

</LayoutGrid>

For convenience, we've split the following into their own sections:

<LayoutGrid 
  className={styles.grid} 
  columnGap={{ xs: 'sm', lg: 'lg' }}
  rowGap={{ xs: 'sm', lg: 'lg' }}
>
  <AboutCell
    emoji="💸"
    examples={["Avatar", "Quote", "Testimonial"]}
    kind="Brand"
  >
    Components across the design spectrum that are more tied to brand representation and/or marketing purposes.
  </AboutCell>
  <AboutCell
    emoji="🎨"
    story="Colors"
    kind="Atoms"
    title="Colors"
  >
    Brand color atoms we select from in creating designs. All colors seen on Codecademy properties should adhere to these.
  </AboutCell>
  <AboutCell
    emoji="🗺"
    examples={["ContentContainer", "LayoutGrid"]}
    kind="Atoms/Layouts/About"
    story="Page"
    title="Layouts"

    Sizing and padding container atoms.
    These position our elements on pages in standard responsive layouts.
