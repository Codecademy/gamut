<strong>
  The design system for Codecademy{' '}

    ✨
  </span>
</strong>

Gamut components, styles, and utilities are the core of the Codecademy brand shared across its websites.
They're most notably used on <a href="https://codecademy.com">codecademy.com</a> but are also found on our internal websites and tools, as well as on our mobile application.

This storybook represents components found in the Codecademy [Client Modules](https://github.com/Codecademy/client-modules) repo.
Its organization roughly aligns with variations of <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a>.
