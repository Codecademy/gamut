<Meta
  title={title}
  component={AppBar}
  subcomponents={{ AppBarSection }}
  parameters={{

This is an example of an AppBar component that contains one left-oriented
AppBarSection that holds one AppBar Tab.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="AppBar">
    {() => (
      <AppBar>
        <AppBarSection position="left" />
      </AppBar>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<PropsTable of={AppBar} />

## Header

This is an example of how our headers use the AppBar component to format
various sections in a bar (left, center, and right). The AppBar can hold
as many AppBarSections as you'd like.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Header">
    {() => (
      <AppBar>
        <AppBarSection position="left">
          <Logo />
        </AppBarSection>
        <AppBarSection position="center">Pricing</AppBarSection>
        <AppBarSection position="right">Sign In</AppBarSection>
      </AppBar>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
