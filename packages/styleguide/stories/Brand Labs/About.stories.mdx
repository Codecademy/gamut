      'Components across the design spectrum that exist for utility, are more experimental, or are tied to brand representation.',
  }}
/>

Components across the design spectrum that are frequently used but too specific to truly be a part of our core design system. These logos, testimonials, and so on are also updated relatively more frequently than other components.

These components will be moved to our [client-modules](https://github.com/Codecademy/client-modules) repository in the near future.
