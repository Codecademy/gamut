# AccordionButton

<StoryStatus status="inProgress" />

A very simple, stateless molecule consisting of a single button and icon.
It serves as the top of any collapsible/expandable content, such as a
"hint" section in the LE or a list of department jobs on a careers page.

It's likely we'll eventually create an `Accordion`, which might
replace usage of this `AccordionButton`. Until then the body of
the accordion is managed separately in consuming locations.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Accordion">
    <AccordionButton
      expanded={boolean('Expanded', false)}
      onClick={action('Clicked')}
      theme={select('Theme', ['blue', 'plain', 'yellow'], 'yellow')}
    >
      Click 'Expanded' To Toggle Me
    </AccordionButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Themes

#### Blue

Blue accordion tops are only usable in dark contexts, such as the LE's
Help Menu.

<Preview className="dark">
  <Story name="Blue">
    <AccordionButton
      expanded={boolean('Expanded', false)}
      onClick={action('Clicked')}
      theme="blue"
    >
      Click 'Expanded' To Toggle Me
    </AccordionButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

#### Plain

Plain accordion tops are best applied in plain pages such as marketing pages
where we haven't been able to invest yet in a more solid theme.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Plain">
    <AccordionButton
      expanded={boolean('Expanded', false)}
      onClick={action('Clicked')}
      theme="plain"
    >
      Click 'Expanded' To Toggle Me
    </AccordionButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

#### Yellow

Yellow accordion tops are our favorite: they look the most professional on
their own. They're only used in the "Get a Hint" sections of the LE's
narrative pane.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Yellow">
    <AccordionButton
      expanded={boolean('Expanded', false)}
      onClick={action('Clicked')}
      theme="yellow"
    >
      Click 'Expanded' To Toggle Me
    </AccordionButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>
