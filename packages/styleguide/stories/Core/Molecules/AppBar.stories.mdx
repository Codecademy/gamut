# AppBar

<StoryStatus status="volatile" />

This is an example of an AppBar component that contains one left-oriented
AppBarSection that holds one AppBar Tab. These components mostly provide
spacing and layout help that you can use for something like a footer or
header

<Canvas>
  <Story name="AppBar">
    <AppBar>
      <AppBarSection position="left"></AppBarSection>
    </AppBar>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Props of={AppBar} />

## Header

This is an example of how our headers use the AppBar component to format
various sections in a bar (left, center, and right). The AppBar can hold
as many AppBarSections as you'd like.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Header">
    <AppBar>
      <AppBarSection position="left">
        <Logo />
      </AppBarSection>
      <AppBarSection position="center">Pricing</AppBarSection>
      <AppBarSection position="right">Sign In</AppBarSection>
    </AppBar>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
