# Interstitial

<StoryStatus status="stable" />

Large content area used as a break between focused content, such as within
a full-screen <code>Overlay</code> in the LE between lessons.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Interstitial">
    <Interstitial
      buttons={[
        <Button key="1" theme="brand-yellow">
          One Button
        </Button>,
        <Button key="2" theme="white" outline>
          Two Button
        </Button>,
      ]}
      title="What a Glorious Day"
    >
      Place some happy text as the content of this interstitial for the learner
      to feel good about themselves. Note that the max-width for this content is
      large but not too large. We want some amount of vertical centering!

## Decorations

Decorations are added on top of the heading and are narrated as part of
it. Put emojis or promotional images here to really emphasize them.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Decorated Interstitial">
    <Interstitial
      buttons={[
        <Button key="1" theme="brand-red">
          Red Button
        </Button>,
        <Button key="2" theme="brand-blue">
          Blue Button
        </Button>,
      ]}
      decoration="😍"
      title="Decorations, too!"
    >
      I really love emojis. Please confirm you love emojis too!
