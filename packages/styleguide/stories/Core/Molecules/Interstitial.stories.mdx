        Place some happy text as the content of this interstitial for the
        learner to feel good about themselves. Note that the max-width for this
        content is large but not too large. We want some amount of vertical
        centering!

## Decorations

Decorations are added on top of the heading and are narrated as part of
it. Put emojis or promotional images here to really emphasize them.
