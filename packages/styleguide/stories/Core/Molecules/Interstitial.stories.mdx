Large content area used as a break between focused content, such as within
a full-screen <code>Overlay</code> in the LE between lessons.

        <Button key="1" theme="brand-yellow">
          One Button

      Place some happy text as the content of this interstitial for the learner
      to feel good about themselves. Note that the max-width for this content is
      large but not too large. We want some amount of vertical centering!

## Decorations

Decorations are added on top of the heading and are narrated as part of
it. Put emojis or promotional images here to really emphasize them.
