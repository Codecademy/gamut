# Accordion

<StoryStatus status="inProgress" />

A molecule consisting of a clickable header that animates show or hide its children,
such as a "hint" section in the LE or a list of department jobs on a careers page.

Both its header text and general children can be any arbitrary content, or can be
conditionally rendered based on whether the accordion is expanded.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Accordion">
    <Accordion
      header="Click to Toggle Me!"
      onChange={action('Changed')}
      theme={select('Theme', ['blue', 'plain', 'yellow'], 'yellow')}
    >
      Wow, hidden treasure!
    </Accordion>

### Themes

#### Blue

Blue accordion tops are only usable in dark contexts, such as the LE's
Help Menu.

<Preview className="dark">
  <Story name="Blue">
    <Accordion
      header="Click to Toggle Me!"
      onChange={action('Changed')}
      theme="blue"
    >
      Wow, hidden treasure!
    </Accordion>
  </Story>
</Preview>

#### Plain

Plain accordion tops are best applied in plain pages such as marketing pages
where we haven't been able to invest yet in a more solid theme.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Plain">
    <Accordion
      header="Click to Toggle Me!"
      onChange={action('Changed')}
      theme="plain"
    >
      Wow, hidden treasure!
    </Accordion>
  </Story>
</Preview>

#### Yellow

Yellow accordion tops are our favorite: they look the most professional on
their own. They're only used in the "Get a Hint" sections of the LE's
narrative pane.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Yellow">
    <Accordion
      header="Click to Toggle Me!"
      onChange={action('Changed')}
      theme="yellow"
    >
      Wow, hidden treasure!
    </Accordion>
  </Story>
</Preview>
