# Accordion

<StoryStatus status="volatile" />

A molecule consisting of a "top" section and an expandable body,
such as a "hint" section in the LE or a list of department jobs on a careers page.

Both its header text and general children can be any arbitrary content.
Most accordions should use an `AccordionButton`; other forms of buttons are acceptable for custom accordions.

  <Story name="Accordion">
    {() => {
      const expanded = boolean('Expanded');
      return (
        <Accordion
          expanded={expanded}
          top={<AccordionButton expanded={expanded}>Click me!</AccordionButton>}
        >
          Hidden treasure!
        </Accordion>
      );

> Note that accordions will fit to `100%` of the the height of their parent container.
> If you need a fixed height container, wrap the accordion in a `<div>`.
