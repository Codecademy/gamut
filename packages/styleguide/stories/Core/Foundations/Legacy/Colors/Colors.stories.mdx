<StoryStatus status="stable" />

These are the color palettes used by both design and engineering. This is **only** the documentation for SCSS variables and their usage. For typescript and CSS-in-JS variables please visit the [Theme Docs](?path=/docs/foundations-theme--page#standard-colors).

**NOTE**: Not all colors are available on the emotion theme (but all are available via [`@codecademy/gamut-styles`](https://npmjs.com/@codecademy/gamut-styles)).

## Usage

In order to use these color variables you will need to add the import somewhere in your `SCSS` import tree. This will be necessary to import for all CSS Module style files.

```css
@import '@codecademy/gamut-styles/utils';

.standardRed {
  color: $color-blue;
}
```

If you are using deprecated colors but require them in a typescript file you can

## Common Color Sets

Standard color tokens we select from in creating designs. All colors on
Codecademy properties should adhere to these. Remember your accessibility
contrast requirements too!

### Standard Colors

<DataTable {...TABLES.standard} />

### Interactive Colors

For usage on links, buttons, and other interactive elements on dark and light backgrounds

<DataTable {...TABLES.interactive} />

## Swatches

Full-color swatches.

<DataTable {...TABLES.swatch} />

## Legacy Colors

These are older colors that are not in our current visual identity, but may still exist in various parts of our application. They are not available on the `Theme` but can still be accessed in typescript.

### Platform Colors (Learning Environment)

Our Learning Environment ("LE") is, for now, an exception to the rule
about containing only brand and grid colors. It uses a selection of muted
grayish purples and a few mid-range minty greens.

TS: `import { platformColors } from "@codecademy/gamut-styles";`

<DataTable {...TABLES.platform} />

### Editor Colors

The LE's code editor uses its own colors for text.

TS: `import { editorColors } from "@codecademy/gamut-styles";`

<DataTable {...TABLES.editor} />

### Brand Colors

These are our old brand colors.

TS: `import { brandColors } from "@codecademy/gamut-styles";`

<DataTable {...TABLES.brand} />

### Swatches

TS: `import { deprecatedColors } from "@codecademy/gamut-styles";`

<DataTable {...TABLES.deprecated} />
