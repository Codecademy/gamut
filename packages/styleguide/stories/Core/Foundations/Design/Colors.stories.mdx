# Colors

## General

- **Brand Colors**: Navy (dark) and Beige (light)
- **Interactive Colors**: Hyper (on light backgrounds) and Yellow (on dark backgrounds)
- Hyper is not to be used in branding, as a page background, or to signify “Pro” or any other product.
- Use wash colors for page backgrounds. We’ll need to add more rules around this, so consult with Brendan before specing a new page with bgnd color.
- Be careful if using a wash color for something besides a background, as it may be difficult to ensure readability

## Colors and Type

- Use black or navy text at all sizes on light or normal backgrounds.
- Use hyper at all sizes on light backgrounds.
- Be careful using hyper at normal sizes on color backgrounds (AA)
- Using hyper/links on normal color bgnds is discouraged. Try using a filled button to ensure axccible affordances,.
- On Navy/Black bgnds, use beige/white for reverse text and yellow for reverse links at all sizes
- You may reverse large text on Dark Color Bgnds (except orange) by using beige or white. On orange, you must use navy/black. Never reverse normal size text on dark color bgnds (we can achieve this if we add darker color bgnd variations)
- There are secondary text colors which you may use sparingly to establish difference, mainli in UI. These should only be used on light color, beige or white bgnds. Choose the secondary text color which matches your primary text color.
