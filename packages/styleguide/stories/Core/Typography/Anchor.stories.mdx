# Anchors

<StoryStatus status="stable" />

Use this component for basic inline text links.
It applies `text-decoration: underline` per our accessibility guidelines to distiguish them with more than just a purple color from body text.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Anchor">
    {(args) => {
      return (
        <Text>
          This is a{' '}
          <Anchor
            {...args}
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
            target="_blank"
          >
            great video
          </Anchor>
          .
        </Text>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Props story="Anchor" />

## Anchor Guidelines

Links are really hard to get right for accessibility!
Most importantly: links must be _visually distinct_ from body text.
For general links in body text, we use a visual underline to make it clear that they're links.

<Text>
  <Anchor href="/">This is a link</Anchor>. This is not.
</Text>

If you're designing a different visual that requires a link, unless your link text is clearly positioned separately from body text in a way that implies it's a link, remember [color contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) and [non-color visual distinction](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F73.html): users who are color-blind and/or low vision should still be able to see the link and text distinction.
