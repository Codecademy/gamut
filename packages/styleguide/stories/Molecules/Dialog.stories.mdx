## Use cases

- Use regular Dialogs to have users accept a specific state of the system or force a user to see something.
- Use warning Dialogs to warn the user of the consequences of the action they may take

## Key principles

- Dialogs appear unprompted and require confirmation before the user can continue.
- Use the modal component sparingly. This is the most dispruptive tool in our arsenal. We should only have a small handful of these in our system at any given time.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Dialog" height="600px">
    {(args) => {
      return <Dialog {...args} />;
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<PropsTable story="Dialog" />

## Usage Guidelines

- Dialogs have a min-width of 400px
- Dialog height changes depending on the body-text length.
- Dialog has light and dark theme variants and each mode is colored differently.
- Warning Dialogs should use a red CTA button (light mode: white text on #E91C11 background, dark mode: navy text on #E85D7F background)
- Dialogs use pattern at 80% opacity to give component depth.
- Dialogs should always be displayed over an overlay. The overlay in light mode should be white at 95% opacity, the overlay in dark mode should be black at 75% opacity.

## Location

- Dialogs should be centered inside of the window.

## Color Modes

We currently support 2 color modes for Dialog `dark` and `light`.

### Light

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Light" height="600px">
    {(args) => {
      return <Dialog {...args} />;
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Dark

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Dark" height="600px" args={{ mode: 'dark' }}>
    {(args) => {
      return <Dialog {...args} />;
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
