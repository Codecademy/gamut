          Baharroth - Baharroth, "the Cry of the Wind," is the Winged Phoenix,
          the oldest of the Swooping Hawks and the first Exarch of those winged
          Aspect Warriors. Baharroth is the founder of the Eldar Warrior Path
          that is represented today by the Swooping Hawks Aspect Shrines.
          Baharroth is also known for his speed and is said to be the fastest of
          all the Eldar who have ever lived, a formidable claim that would make
          him a deadly opponent indeed. Though he moves with the subtlety and
          grace of a zephyr, he attacks with the force of a hurricane.

          An Avatar of Khaine is the term normally applied to the physical form
          that the spirit of an Eldar God has managed to possess and animate.
          This term is most often applied to the physical body possessed by a
          fragment of the spirit of the Eldar God of War Kaela Mensha Khaine,
          though the term can actually apply to any divine entity of the Warp
          that has found some way to take on a corporeal form within realspace.

## I take up space. + I have a tab button. Deal with it.

Sometimes Sidebars are just components that need to take up space. We get it. This one will take up the height of its parent container, so jot that down.
