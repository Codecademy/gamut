          An Avatar of Khaine is the term normally applied to the physical form
          that the spirit of an Eldar God has managed to possess and animate.
          This term is most often applied to the physical body possessed by a
          fragment of the spirit of the Eldar God of War Kaela Mensha Khaine,
          though the term can actually apply to any divine entity of the Warp
          that has found some way to take on a corporeal form within realspace.

## I take up space.

Sometimes Sidebars are just components that need to take up space. We get it.

<Canvas>

    {(args) => (
      <FlexBox height="20rem">
        <Sidebar expanded={true} {...args}>
