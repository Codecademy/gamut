## Use cases

- Use regular modals to have users accept a specific state of the system or force a user to see something.
- Use warning modals to warn the user of the consequences of the action they may take

## Key principles

- Modals appear unprompted and require confirmation before the user can continue.
- Use the modal component sparingly. This is the most dispruptive tool in our arsenal. We should only have a small handful of these in our system at any given time.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Modal" height="600px">
    {(args) => {
      return <Modal {...args} />;
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Props story="Modal" />

## Style

- Modals have a min-width of 400px
- Modal height changes depending on the body-text length.
- Modal has light and dark theme variants and each mode is colored differently.
- Warning Modals should use a red CTA button (light mode: white text on #E91C11 background, dark mode: navy text on #E85D7F background)
- Modals use pattern at 80% opacity to give component depth.
- Modals should always be displayed over an overlay. The overlay in light mode should be white at 95% opacity, the overlay in dark mode should be black at 75% opacity.

## Location

- Modals should be centered inside of the window.
