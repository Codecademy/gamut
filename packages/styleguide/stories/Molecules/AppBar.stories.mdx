import { Meta, Props, Canvas, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs/dist/blocks';

import { Logo } from '@codecademy/gamut-labs/src';
import { AppBar, AppBarSection } from '@codecademy/gamut/src';
import title from '../../.storybook/title.macro.js';

<Meta
  title={title}
  component={AppBar}
  subcomponents={{ AppBarSection }}
  parameters={{
    subtitle: `Components that provide
spacing and layout help that you can use for something like a footer or
header`,

/>

This is an example of an AppBar component that contains one left-oriented
AppBarSection that holds one AppBar Tab.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="AppBar">
    {(args) => (
      <AppBar>
        <AppBarSection position="left"></AppBarSection>
      </AppBar>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Props of={AppBar} />

## Header

This is an example of how our headers use the AppBar component to format
various sections in a bar (left, center, and right). The AppBar can hold
as many AppBarSections as you'd like.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Header">
    {(args) => (
      <AppBar>
        <AppBarSection position="left">
          <Logo />
        </AppBarSection>
        <AppBarSection position="center">Pricing</AppBarSection>
        <AppBarSection position="right">Sign In</AppBarSection>
      </AppBar>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
