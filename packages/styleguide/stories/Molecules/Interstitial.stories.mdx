Large content area used as a break between focused content, such as within
a full-screen [Overlay](?path=/docs/atoms-overlay--overlay) in the LE between lessons.

        learner to feel good about themselves. Note that the max-width for this
        content is large but not too large. We want some amount of vertical

## With Buttons

If the `buttons` props is provided, the components will render underneath the title and children.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Single Button"
    args={{
      buttons: [
        <ButtonDeprecated key="1" theme="brand-red">
          Red Button
        </ButtonDeprecated>,
      ],
      title: 'A Single Button!',
      children: `Buttons are really cool, right??`,
    }}
  >
    {(args) => <Interstitial {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Two Buttons"
    args={{
      buttons: [
        <ButtonDeprecated key="1" theme="brand-red">
          Red Button
        </ButtonDeprecated>,
        <ButtonDeprecated key="2" theme="brand-blue">
          Blue Button
        </ButtonDeprecated>,
      ],
      title: 'Two Buttons!',
      children: `Buttons are even cooler when there's more of them!`,
    }}
  >
    {(args) => <Interstitial {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Decorations

Decorations are added on top of the heading and are narrated as part of
it. Put emojis or promotional images here to really emphasize them.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Emoji Decorated Interstitial"
    args={{
      decoration: '😍',
      title: 'Emoji Decoration!',
      children: `I really love emojis. Please confirm you love emojis too!`,
    }}
  >
    {(args) => <Interstitial {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

export const Img = styled.img`
  height: 200px;
`;

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Image Decorated Interstitial"
    args={{
      decoration: (
        <Img src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/components/curriculum/path/learn-how-to-build-websites/curriculum-card.svg" />
      ),
      title: 'Image Decoration!',
      children: `Sometimes, all you need is an image to capture the attention of the user... what about a picture of a dog? Do dogs or cats perform better? Or maybe a parrot? `,
    }}
  >
    {(args) => <Interstitial {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
