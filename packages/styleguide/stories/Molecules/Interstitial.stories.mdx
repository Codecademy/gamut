        Place some happy text as the content of this interstitial for the
        learner to feel good about themselves. Note that the max-width for this
        content is large but not too large. We want some amount of vertical
        centering!

## Decorations

Decorations are added on top of the heading and are narrated as part of
it. Put emojis or promotional images here to really emphasize them.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Decorated Interstitial">
    {(args) => (
      <Interstitial
        focus
        buttons={[
          <ButtonDeprecated key="1" theme="brand-red">
            Red Button
          </ButtonDeprecated>,
          <ButtonDeprecated key="2" theme="brand-blue">
            Blue Button
          </ButtonDeprecated>,
        ]}
        decoration="😍"
        title="Decorations, too!"
      >
        I really love emojis. Please confirm you love emojis too! This
        interstitial also has the focus prop, so focus will be drawn to the
        Title of this component upon render if the learner if using a screen
        reader.
