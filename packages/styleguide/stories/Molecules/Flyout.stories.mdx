An example of an organism that uses Flyout is the <LinkTo id="organisms-layoutmenu--layout-menu">LayoutMenu</LinkTo>.
Internally, Flyout is a combination of <LinkTo id="molecules-modals-overlay--overlay">Overlay</LinkTo> and <LinkTo id="atoms-drawer--drawer">Drawer</LinkTo>.

Our Flyouts are [controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), so their checked value must be controlled by an external state passed in as `expanded` and `onChange`:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Flyout">
    {(args) => {
      const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
      return (
        <Box height="20rem">

            {...args}
            expanded={expanded}
            title="About Baharroth"
            onClose={() => setExpanded(false)}
          >
            <Box textColor="text" m={16}>
              Baharroth, &quot;the Cry of the Wind,&quot; is the Winged Phoenix,
              the oldest of the Swooping Hawks and the first Exarch of those
              winged Aspect Warriors. Baharroth is the founder of the Eldar
              Warrior Path that is represented today by the Swooping Hawks
              Aspect Shrines. Baharroth is also known for his speed and is said
              to be the fastest of all the Eldar who have ever lived, a
              formidable claim that would make him a deadly opponent indeed.
              Though he moves with the subtlety and grace of a zephyr, he
              attacks with the force of a hurricane.

            An Avatar of Khaine is the term normally applied to the physical
            form that the spirit of an Eldar God has managed to possess and
            animate. This term is most often applied to the physical body
            possessed by a fragment of the spirit of the Eldar God of War Kaela
            Mensha Khaine, though the term can actually apply to any divine
            entity of the Warp that has found some way to take on a corporeal
            form within realspace.

Flyouts work in light and dark `ColorModes`.

              Horus Heresy, sometimes many millennia later. Some are not whole
              Chapters but simply warbands composed of a few tens or hundreds of

              charismatic commander or Chaos Lord.

## Flyout with overflow

Flyouts scroll on vertical overflow and keep the background color.
