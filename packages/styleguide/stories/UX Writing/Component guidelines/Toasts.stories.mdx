Toasts are small messages that show up in a box at the bottom right corner of the screen to notify the user about something. It’s most commonly used when immediate feedback is needed for learners upon completing a learning task in LE (such as unlocking an achievement).

Toasts may also be used outside of the LE to communicate information relevant to a learner’s personal experience (such as announcing the launch of a Codecademy Chromebook app to Chromebook users).

Toasts may contain any or all of the following: a title, a description, and/or an icon (in line with the title or left-justified). Here’s what a toast looks like with all three. The megaphone icon is used for announcements.

<Canvas>
  <Toast
    title={
      <>
        <MegaphoneIcon verticalAlign="middle" mr={4} /> Calling all Chromebook
        users!
      </>
    }
  >
    You can now install Codecademy as a free app directly on your Chromebook.{' '}
    <Anchor>Get the app.</Anchor>
  </Toast>
</Canvas>

## Best practices

- **Keep it brief.** Keep the copy to 3 lines (including the optional title). For a title and 2-line description, aim for keeping the title to 30 characters and the description to 70 characters.
- **Make it personal and relevant.** The information shared should be relevant to a learner’s personal experience. For instance, the Chromebook example above would only be shared with learners that are using Codecademy on a Chromebook.
- **Avoid distracting from learning.** Be cautious with using toasts in the Learning Environment (LE). If the message is not something that is pertinent to the learning experience, it should be communicated outside of the LE.
