## Overview

Inclusivity is one of Codecademy's four core brand pillars. At its heart, our brand represents the idea that _everyone_ should be empowered to build an inspiring career in tech. So when we say something that excludes a person or group from that idea, it's not just inconsiderate. It's off-brand.

Generally, writers are more aware of language that excludes themselves, since they feel that exclusion every time they read it. So be extra-vigilant for language that excludes groups you don't identify with. That requires learning about those groups on a continual basis and recognizing what you do and don't know.

Below are broad guidelines on how to align your writing with our inclusivity brand pillar. They are by no means exhaustive and should be taken as a starting point. The most effective approach to inclusive writing is to involve people of various identities. For more information on how Codecademy approaches inclusivity, join our DEI slack channel: SLACK CHANNEL NAME.

## Writing inclusively

_[Below info is just notes.]_

1. Avoid language that assigns a positive or negative value to traits (suffers from, confined to, bravely overcame)
2. Avoid prescriptive language when talking about people (NO: Adobe Photoshop is for graphic designers and photographers; YES: Adobe Photoshop helps you create graphics and photographs)
3. Use the singular they, unless talking about a specific person who has shared their pronouns.

We'll be putting together official guidelines on writing inclusively as part of our broader company style guide. The [Apple Style Guide](https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/apd91d6c2458) has a fantastic section on writing inclusively. But, in the meantime, here are a few things to keep in mind.

**Use inclusive language.**

Use inclusive language that makes all learners feel welcome. This includes using gender-neutral language and avoiding violent, ableist, and oppressive terms. The Prevention, Advocacy & Resource Center at Brandeis has put together an [Oppressive Language List](https://www.brandeis.edu/parc/accountability/oppressivelanguagelist.html) of words to avoid.

**Avoid idioms, slang, humor, and jargon.**

Our learners come from all over the world, so avoid using idioms, slang, and humor as they may not translate to other cultures. Additionally, it's important to remember that just because we may be familiar with technical concepts or jargon, our learners may not be.

**Write for all devices.**

Our learners may be visiting our site using different browsers, mobile devices, or accessibility tools. Avoid language that is device-specific unless we know the terminology will make sense for all learners. For instance, avoid words like "Click" or "Tap" if there's a possibility that learners may be on different types of devices.

### Golden rules

1. When in doubt, do some research or ask for help.
2. If someone calls out a concern, listen to them.
3. Don't make "gut" decisions or "safe" assumptions.

<Story name="Harmful language" />

### Don't use harmful language

At its most basic level, inclusive writing is writing that doesn't exclude any person or group through the use of words, phrases, or concepts that harm that group. Most commonly, this concerns language that's inclusive of all genders, ethnicities, religions, geographies, appearances, abilities, and other identifying traits.

**Assuming a "norm"**

There is no standard person. So when speaking generally, don't refer to specific identities or traits. And when choosing examples, make sure to represent a broad, diverse group (check out the inclusive name generator linked below).

**Historical context**

Many common words or phrases originate from problematic ideas. So understanding the full context of what you're saying and including multiple perspectives is crucial. Even if a word or phrase is the "standard," it shouldn't be used if it's harmful.

**Negative connotations**

Some common phrases aren't directly harmful, but can cause harm by reinforcing a connotation that negatively impacts a group. Certain colors representing "good" or "bad," or assigning traditionally "feminine" or "masculine" traits to

**Don't say this**

He/she (in generalities)

---

Master/slave components

---

**Instead, say this**

---

They (non-gendered singular)

---

Controller/follower components

Those were dire times

<Story name="Subtext" />

### Think deeply about subtext

Often, language can imply something without saying it directly. This can be a powerful way to subtly shepherd someone's thoughts in the right direction â€” or in the wrong direction. Think about various ways your copy could be interpreted or what it is your implying either purposefully or accidentally. Getting fresh eyes and diverse perspectives on your copy is a great way to suss out subtext you may not have seen yourself.

**Assigning value unnecessarily**

Don't assign a positive or negative value to traits that aren't inherently or objectively positive or negative. Whenever you're assigning a positive or negative value to something, pause to make sure the value-judgment is necessary.

**Prescriptive language**

Don't describe something in a way that limits who can use it or assumes whom it's for. Instead, describe what it does or the benefits it provides

<Story name="Idioms" />

### Be wary of idioms

While idioms and other colorful phrases can be a great way of making copy more fun and conversational, they can often be exclusionary. When using any phrase that doesn't mean what it literally says, question if it's necessary.

**Cultural exclusion**

Phrases that don't say what they literally mean rely on cultural context and inherited knowledge to convey meaning. So people who don't have the same context or knowledge as you, like those who live in a different culture or speak a different native language, are often left confused. Only keep an idiom if understanding it isn't necessary to understand the overall message.

**Harmful origins**

Idioms are a great example of outdated ideas hiding within common language. If you're not sure where an idiom or non-literal phrase comes from, look it up. If it involves anything Codecademy wouldn't say today, don't say it in an idiom.

**Hidden idioms**

Some phrases, word uses, or colloquial expressions may not seem like idioms to native speakers. So be on the lookout for anything that's not completely literal, and go from there. It can sometimes help to think, "Could this cause a misunderstanding if I said it to a chatbot?"

**Don't say this**

The cat's out of the bag

---

Comments from the peanut gallery

**Instead, say this**

---

The secret's out

---

Comments from random people

### What to do when we mess up

1. Pause. Avoid reactionary decision-making. Don't respond on Twitter, or start a public debate, or get defensive. Just wait a moment and think it through.
2. Escalate to the right group. Typically, that's Codecademy's DEI consultants, the creative lead on that project, and the owners of any channel where that asset was published.
3. That group should make an informed decision on how to move forward based on our core brand principles. Include a variety of people outside your team in that decision, such as affinity group leaders or the DEI working group. Document the decision and the reasoning behind it.
