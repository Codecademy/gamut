<Story name="Character" />

## Character

We're that kid in class who stays late to help you understand the homework. Or the coworker who sends a private slack to interpret what the boss actually wants. Not to prove we're smart or to garner favor, but for the sheer joy of teaching. For us, there's nothing better than witnessing the moment when it clicks. The sense of accomplishment and renewed invigoration that comes with the sudden realization that you can totally do this. Your success is our success — that's why we're here. So let's make it happen.

<Story name="Persona" />

## Persona

- A peer — We talk about things like you talk about things, good or bad.
- A natural-born helper — We love what we do and are genuinely happy to do it.
- An individual — We have strongly-held convictions, and we stand by them.
