### 1. Consider the big picture

Before you start writing, consider the full context:

- Where will learners be in their journey when they see this copy?
- What is the learner's goal and how will this copy help them achieve it?
- What is our business goal and how will this copy help achieve it?
- What questions might learners have that we should answer?
- Make a list of all the information this copy will need to address.

### 2. Say it out loud, then write it down

Once you know what information you need to include, say it out loud as if you're explaining the situation to one of our learners. Speak directly to the learner, using "you." After you've said it out loud, write it down. This is your first draft and will help ensure your writing is natural and conversational.

### 3. Cut any unnecessary words

Cut any words that aren't necessary for learners to understand the message. Remove words that are repetitive or redundant. Once you've cut things down, you can always add words back in to make the copy sound friendlier or more encouraging if it feels too robotic.

### 4. Use consistent language

Make sure the words you're using match the words we use to talk about the same things elsewhere in the product. This also goes for keeping language consistent between headers, body copy, and button copy within a single component. Switching terms can be an unnecessary source of confusion for learners.

### 5. Ensure language includes everyone

Use inclusive language that makes all learners feel welcome. Avoid idioms, slang, humor, and jargon to appeal to a global audience. Write for all devices and ensure every element has text for screen readers to speak.

### 6. Do a readability check

Paste your copy into [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to check for readability.

- Aim for a 7th-grade reading level or below
- Simplify any sentences that are "hard to read" or "very hard to read"

### 7. Do a style check

Check your copy against our [brand voice guidelines](https://www.notion.so/Brand-Voice-Guide-39dcf229da9242f78b0791567a43884c). Here are some notes to keep in mind:

- Use sentence case for headings and button copy
- Always use oxford commas
- Put spaces around your em dashes ( â€” )
- Use exclamation points sparingly, default to periods
- Use periods at the end of complete sentences

### 8. Have someone else read your work

When you're done, show the copy to someone else. It's best if it's someone that's not familiar with the project you're working on. They should be able to easily understand the information you listed out in step 1.

**When you're done, your copy should:**

<CustomCheckbox
  htmlFor="checklist-1"
  label="Meet both user needs and business objectives"
  spacing="tight"
/>
<CustomCheckbox
  htmlFor="checklist-2"
  label="Sound natural and conversational"
  spacing="tight"
/>
<CustomCheckbox htmlFor="checklist-3" label="Be concise" spacing="tight" />
<CustomCheckbox
  htmlFor="checklist-4"
  label="Use consistent language"
  spacing="tight"
