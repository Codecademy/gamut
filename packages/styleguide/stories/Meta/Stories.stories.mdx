# Stories

> 🏗 We're still building these opinions out, so don't expect all stories to adhere just yet!

## Story Structure

In our fledgling collective opinion, a good component story page consists of:

1. A single "flagship" demonstration story of the component's commonly used props
2. Stories for each of the props or prop groups that modify the component's behavior

### Flagship Demonstrations

The first story for a component should be intended to give the reader a broad overview of its high-level functionality.
Try to include the major behaviors for the component that most readers would need to understand its uses.

Give this story the same name as its component in camelCase.
Its description should describe at least:

- What the component does
- What it would typically be used for

```tsx
export const progressBar = decoratedStory(() => (
  <StoryTemplate status={StoryStatus.InProgress}>
    <StoryDescription>
      <code>ProgressBar</code>s are to be used when you would like to indicate a
      known or somewhat-known amount of progress along a fixed course. For
      example, you might show one on a quiz page indicating how many questions
      have been completed.
    </StoryDescription>
    {/* ... */}
  </StoryTemplate>
));
```

If your component has several possible variations and is small enough to fit many of them on the screen at once,
use a `LayoutGrid` with `"sm"` gaps to showcase them all neatly.

```tsx
<LayoutGrid columnGap="sm" rowGap="sm">
  {['blue', 'yellow'].map(theme => (
    <Column key={theme} size={6}>
      <ProgressBar percent={50} theme={theme} />
    </Column>
  )}
</LayoutGrid>
```

Otherwise, show a single reasonable default for the component, and allow configuring its props using knobs.

```tsx
<ProgressBar percent={number('Percent', 50)} />
```

### Granular Stories

Each subsequent story should elaborate on an important behavioral feature of the component.
Try to show a single use of the behavior configurable with knobs.

```tsx
export const minimumPercent = decoratedStory(() => (
  <StoryTemplate status={StoryStatus.InProgress}>
    <StoryDescription>
      Some bars (generally small ones) should display at least a little bit of
      progress, even if the technical progress number is zero. You can use the
      <code>minimumPercent</code> prop for a minimum visual width percentage.
    </StoryDescription>
    <ProgressBar
      minimumPercent={number('Minimum Percent', 5)}
      percent={number('Percent', 0)}
      theme="blue"
    />
  </StoryTemplate>
));
```

## Knobs

Storybook knobs are great!
Give them names in Title Case and use them directly in your story JSX.

```tsx
<ProgressBar minimumPercent={number('Minimum Percent', 5)} />
```
