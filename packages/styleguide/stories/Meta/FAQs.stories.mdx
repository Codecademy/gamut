Please let us know if there are questions you'd like answered here!

## How Can I Contribute?

Thanks for your interest! ðŸ™Œ
We are not prepared to accept external contributions at this time.
Neither our internal processes nor the design system are stabilized enough for non-team-members.

## To Gamut or Not To Gamut?

In general, we prefer Gamut components to be those that are commonly shared across multiple experiences in the monolith.
If something can be easily built from the existing primitives _without_ adding logic, such as a layout+button, we generally wouldn't make a special component for it.

Some examples of things we'd generally include would be:

- Common visually identifiable atoms, such as buttons
- Atoms linked together with client logic, such as an Alert bar

Some examples of things we generally wouldn't include are:

- Customized atoms specially designed for a particular use case
- Groups of components that could be recreated easily
- Jawns

Consider referencing other design systems to see what they choose to turn into generic components.

### Brand or Core?

The "Brand" section of components is an eqivalent to the Fluent "Experimental" or Material UI "Labs" sections.
_(links pending)_
They're still shared across the site, such as with the marketing-style Learner Testimonials, but are too specific to include in the core design system.

Components in this system might "graduate" to the core design system over time.
They might also be discarded if our design team moves away from using them.
Until either, they're treated as experimental and don't always respect semver.

## `style` or `theme`?

proposal: in general, start off with very open style intentionally
open up / enable for ease of use

later on, once the component is more solidified, consider restricting with prescriptive themes

eventual goal will be locked

## What's Going On With Accessibility?

Codecademy is committed to becoming [WCAG 2.1 accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag), and technical accessibility is a must-have in our design system.
Components added here are expected to be fully AA compliant.
