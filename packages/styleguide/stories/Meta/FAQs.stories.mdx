# FAQs

Please let us know if there are questions you'd like answered here!

## How Can I Contribute?

Thanks for your interest! ðŸ™Œ
We are not prepared to accept external contributions at this time.
Neither our internal processes nor the design system are stabilized enough for non-team-members.

## What's Going On With Accessibility?

Codecademy is committed to becoming [WCAG 2.1 accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag), and technical accessibility is a must-have in our design system.
Components added here are expected to be fully AA compliant.
