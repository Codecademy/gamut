## Prework

We track planned work for Gamut components in the [Web Platform Board](https://codecademy.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WEB/boards/1386) on JIRA.

- If there's a ticket there you want to take on, feel free to assign ourself and let us know in Slack.
- If the work you'd like to do isn't captured in a JIRA ticket, talk to us and we can work with you to create that ticket.
- If you would like to make a request for work to be done, please discuss with us and create a ticket on the [Web Request board](https://codecademy.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WEBREQ/boards/181).

## Writing components

### Component structure

Create your component as an `index.tsx` file in a PascalCase-named folder within its package directory, such as `packages/gamut/src/ProgressBar/index.tsx`.
Consider saving this recommended format as an editor snippet:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
import cx from 'classnames';
import React from 'react';
import styles from './styles.module.scss';

export type MyComponentProps = { /* ... */ };

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ /* ... */ }) => {
  // ...
};
```

#### Props documentation

With the exception of widespread, self-documenting props such as `className`, please include a sentence cased description of the prop's intent.
React props on the component will be picked up by Storybook and added to the component's documentation story.
We prefer these be full sentences.

```ts
/**
 * Number of lines to limit the message to.
 */
limit: number;
```

- If your comment purely restartes the name and type of variable, please either elaborate on it or remove the comment altogether.
- Consider starting comments for booleans with _"Whether "_.
- Props such as `className` that are common to many components generally don't need to be documented.

#### Class names

Most components are fairly simple, and consist of one container element with some children.
In that case it's reasonable to add a `className?: string` prop so that consumers can apply positioning styles onto the element.

> Consumers should not use nested selectors (e.g. `.myClassName > div`) to apply styles to your component.
> Doing so is generally a symptom of improperly overriding Gamut styles.

#### `style` or `theme`?

Most components that have configurable themes use one of two APIs:

- `style`: Allowing one or more colors to be passed as values from their parent, such as `Heading`
- `theme`: A pre-configured list of allowed colors, such as `AccordionButton`

We generally prefer components start off with the `style` prop when first created, to allow consumers to more easily flesh out how we'd want to use them.
As we learn more and restrict component usage over time, we might switch to `theme`.

### Unit tests

Your component should have unit tests in a `__tests__/MyComponent-test.tsx` file within its directory.
Use Enzyme's `mount` to test it.

We generally try to unit test all component logic, with the exception of class names in components that contain other logic.

### Stories

All components should have Storybook stories showing their use.
See <LinkTo kind="Meta" story="Stories">Stories</LinkTo> for documentation.

## Pull requests

Please fill out the pull request template, including links to the corresponding Abstract design and JIRA ticket.

> ðŸ˜‰ Protip: You can use a [Draft PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) to still run CI jobs.
> That includes deploying a Netlify preview and publishing alpha package versions to npm.

### Publishing updates

If you know your PR has breaking changes in at least one downstream repository:

1. Before merging it, create PRs in those downstream repositories using your PR's published alpha package versions
2. Verify those PRs work as expected and get them signed off normally
3. Merge your Gamut PR
4. Wait until the new Gamut package is published, then update the downstream repository PRs to use it
5. Merge and deploy those PRs as soon as possible

If your PR contains breaking changes that might affect other users, please mention them in the `#frontend` Slack channel.

## Creating a new package

1. Copy and paste a similar existing package under `packages/`
2. Modify its `package.json`'s `dependencies`, `description`, and `name` to match your new package
3. Set its version to `0.1.0`
4. Replace its `src/` directory with one only containing a `src/index.ts`
5. Remove all content from its `CHANGELOG.md` after the _"See Conventional Commits ..."_ line
6. From the root of the directory, run `yarn`, `yarn lerna bootstrap`, and `yarn build-all`
7. Double-check that the directory contains a `.gitignore` including `dist`

At this point, you can start developing on the new package.
Send a pull request on GitHub and the CI job will auto-publish your package to npm. ðŸš€
