# ðŸ§« Experimental

Components across the design spectrum that are too new and untested to be put in the core Gamut list just yet.
We'll often use this area for new components that have only been used once or twice.
They might be promoted to core once they've been in circulation for a bit longer and we understand better how we'd use them.

We don't yet have anything in here.
Maybe you want to be the first person to add one? ðŸ˜„
