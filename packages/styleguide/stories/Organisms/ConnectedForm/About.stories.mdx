Our Connected- and GridForm organisms provide a easy way to implement forms. While our `Form` atoms compose the structure of these forms, we strongly recommend only creating forms with using `GridForm` or `ConnectedForm`. You should only use the form element atoms as individual elements if your interface doesnâ€™t need to support the technical functions of a form.

Both of our Form organisms provide the following benefits:

1. **Accessibility**: All our forms handle accessibility styling and behaviors, passing tests out-of-the-box.
2. **Functionality**: Validation and submission logic is handled by the [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com) library

We recommend <LinkTo kind='Atoms/GridForm'>GridForm</LinkTo> if you have a form that sticks to a 12x12 visual grid with consistent vertical rhythm and grid spacing.

For everything else, we recommend ConnectedForm.
