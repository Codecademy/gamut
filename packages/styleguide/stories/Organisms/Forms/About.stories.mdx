Our Connected- and GridForm organisms provide a easy way to implement forms. Both of our Form organisms provide the following benefits:

1. **Accessibility**: All our forms handle accessibility styling and behaviors, passing tests out-of-the-box
2. **Functionality**: Validation and submission logic is handled by the [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com) library
