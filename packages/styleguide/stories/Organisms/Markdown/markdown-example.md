### Lists

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens -- interchangably
-- as list markers:

- **Preview:** A live display of the generated HTML as it would render in a browser.
- **HTML Source:** The generated HTML before your browser makes it pretty.
- **Lexer Data:** What [marked] uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.
- **Quick Reference:** A brief run-down of how to format things using markdown.
