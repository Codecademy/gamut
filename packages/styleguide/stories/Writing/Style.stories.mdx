## Principles

### Be real

Trust is hard to come by, but it's easy to lose. If at any point we sound like a for-profit business that's trying to take your money in exchange for our service, we instantly become another faceless corporation. We might as well be Monsanto. Instead, always be hyper-vigilant against things you'd never say in a real-life, face-to-face conversation with a friend. That means no buzzwords, no generic sales phrases, and definitely no formalities.

### Be courageous

We're not here to not get noticed — so the worst thing we can be is ordinary. We're a brand with convictions, a brand that believes in certain things and says those things out loud. Whether we're saying that you should quit your job or that a newly-signed law is immoral or that editing some HTML on your WordPress totally counts as coding and y'all need to stop shaming people over it. We say what we mean to say, and we stand by our word.

### Be supportive

We're asking a lot of people. Imagine it... no really. Imagine that you just now decided to teach yourself an entirely new set of skills — skills that people spend years studying at expensive schools — to start a new career from square one in an unfamiliar industry. That's super scary. People are bound to have doubts, feel discouraged, or think about quitting. So we need to _constantly_ remind them that we believe in them. That we've done this a million times before, that they're on the right track, and that it is totally worth it.

<Story name="Capitalization" />

## Capitalization

**Sentence case for _almost_ everything**

We use sentence case for _almost_ everything. Unless you’re dealing with a title or documented exception, always default to using sentence case. This includes using sentence case for:

- Headlines
- Headings
- Buttons
- Body copy
- Labels

Sentence case refers to capitalizing just the first letter of a string of words, like a sentence. Things we treat as proper nouns, like names or job titles, are still capitalized.

**Title case for titles**

We use title case for:

- Article titles
- Blog titles
- Learner story titles
- Event titles
- Curriculum container and content titles
- Video and video playlist titles

If you’re unsure of how to format using title case, check out [capitalizemytitle.com](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/AP/) (using AP style).

**Exceptions**

We sometimes use all caps when the copy is functioning as a graphical element (as in [this example](https://twitter.com/Codecademy/status/1428762540797014021)), typically in marketing assets.

Exceptions can also be made when copy is off-platform (another site or location not controlled by Codecademy) and the platform has its own styling standards or common practices (using title case in Google search, for example).

**FAQs**

- What if the first letter of a heading or sentence follows a number?
  - Consider the number to be the first character and don't capitalize the letter (i.e. "15 videos").

<Story name="Numbers" />

## Numbers

**General rules**

- Spell out numbers one through nine
- Use numerals for numbers 10 and greater
- Use American styling for large numbers (e.g. 12,345.67)

**Time**

- Always include the timezone and default to eastern time (our office location)(e.g. 1:30pm ET)
- Use the generalized abbreviation, not the daylight savings time abbreviation (e.g. ET, not EST or EDT)
- Include am/pm (with no punctuation) immediately after the time (e.g. 9am ET)
- Only include minutes if the time isn't a whole hour (e.g. 8:40am ET vs. 8am ET)

Follow the [AP stylebook](https://getproofed.com/writing-tips/everything-you-need-to-know-about-numbers-in-ap-style/) for any other specific number styling questions

<Story name="Punctuation" />

## Punctuation

**General rules**

- Always include Oxford commas (the last comma in a serial list)
- Put spaces around your em dashes ( — )
- Only use an exclamation mark when not using one would be strange.
