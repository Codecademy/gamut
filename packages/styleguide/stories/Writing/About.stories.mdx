UX writing is the practice of crafting the text that guides users through their experience with a product. When done strategically, UX writing can help both the people using a product and the organization meet their goals.

At Codecademy, UX writing is a powerful tool that can help us achieve our mission of empowering inspiring careers in technology. By surfacing the right UX copy and content to the right people at the right time, we can help move learners toward their goals. When our learners are successful, so are we.
