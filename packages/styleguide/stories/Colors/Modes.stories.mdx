We've created several color modes by default for light and dark context.

Each color mode consists of a set of aliased color tokens. Each alias has semantic meaning for how the color is used throughout our design system:

Here are some example aliases and their corresponding uses:

- `text`: The standard text color for all type.
- `background`: The base background color.
- `primary`: The color used for interactive elements with a primary action.
- `secondary`: The color used for interactive elements with a secondary action.

Gamut components are built using these aliases instead of referring to specific tokens directly, guaranteeing that:

- Components can be used in ANY context without configuration and work correctly.
- Consistent color scheme and accessibility between contexts.
- Colors usage more meaningful when reading through code as aliases hint to usage.
- Dead simple configuration.

Here's an example using components in context. By toggling dark mode you can see all the colors map to a new color that is accessible for the mode by default.

## `useCurrentMode` | `useColorMode`

For situations where you need to access the current mode in JS, the value of always present on the emotion theme context. If you need the full theme you may use the built in `useTheme` hook from `@emotion/react`. However for cases that are specific to modes only we expose 2 hooks to help.

- `useColorMode()`: If you need access to all modes and their variables this hook will return a tuple of `[mode, modeColors, modes]`.
- `useCurrentMode()`: For simpler usages where you want to get the default mode, this hook returns the key of the active mode.

```tsx
import { useColorMode, useCurrentMode } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

const [current, currentColors, modes] = useColorMode();

const current = useCurrentMode();
```
