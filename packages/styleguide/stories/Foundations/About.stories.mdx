Foundations make up the smallest scale design values that comprise a design system.
Sometimes referred to elsewhere as "tokens", they are the abstract units that comprise and stitch together our atoms, molecules, and organisms.

All of these tokens are available through the Theme object.

Our components are written in our CSS in JS library, [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/). we've created a set of style utilities that we call **System Props** to improve reusability, predictability, and standardization across our design system.
