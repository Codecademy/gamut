## Converting Units

### PX to REM

To keep consistent sizing we like to use `rem` units for most things (within reason).
Many times when a specific REM value is not expressive like `1.875rem` (in this case, `30px`)
it is better to express this as a pixel value that is closer to a round number.

You can do this by using our px => rem utility in both TS and SCSS.

#### `pxRem`

```tsx
import { pxRem } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

pxRem(16); // => 1rem;
pxRem('30px'); // => 1.875rem;
```

## Style Mixins

We also support various style partials to help you consistently achieve affects, like box shadows and screen reader content.

### `fontSmoothing`

We enable font smoothing in some places to make typography more readable.

#### `fontSmoothing`

```tsx
import { fontSmoothPixel } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

// As props
const Smooth = styled.div(fontSmoothing);
```

### No Selection

In cases where we want to prevent the user from selecting an image or text.

#### `noSelect`

```tsx
import { noSelect } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

const Unselectable = styled.div`
  ${noSelect}
`;
```

### Screen Readers

Ensuring that your content is accessible can require you to make screen reader only text elements.
We provide a few helpful mixins for use cases where you want the screen reader to be able to focus or
just be aware of the content.

#### `screenReaderOnly` | `screenReaderOnlyFocusable`

```tsx
import {
  screenReaderOnly,
  screenReaderOnlyFocusable,
} from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

const HiddenLabel = `
  ${screenReaderOnly}
`;

const HiddenLabelWithFocus = `
  ${screenReaderOnlyFocusable}
`;
```
