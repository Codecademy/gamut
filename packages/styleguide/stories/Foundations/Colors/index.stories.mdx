**Deprecation Notice** These variables and access patterns are now deprecated. Please refer to <LinkTo id="foundations-theme--colors">Theme</LinkTo> for the most up to date documentation when using the new visual identity.

## Usage

For the core color palette please use the emotion theme to access them.

## Core Color Palette

Standard color tokens we select from in creating designs. All colors on
Codecademy properties should adhere to these. Remember your accessibility
contrast requirements too!

### Standard Colors

<Story id="foundations-theme--colors" />

### Full Color Swatches

Full-color swatches.

<Story id="foundations-theme--swatches" />

## Platform Specific Palettes

Some applications require more colors than we use in other parts of the application in conjunction with our core palette. These colors should only be used in the learning environment.

These colors are not available on the emotion theme **yet**, but will be soon!

### Standard Colors

Our Learning Environment ("LE") is, for now, an exception to the rule
about containing only brand and grid colors. It uses a selection of muted
grayish purples and a few mid-range minty greens.

```tsx
import { platformColors } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';
```

<DataTable {...TABLES.platform} />

### Editor Colors

The LE's code editor uses its own colors for text.

```tsx
import { editorColors } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';
```

<DataTable {...TABLES.editor} />

## Legacy Colors

These are older colors that are not in our current visual identity, but may still exist in various parts of our application. They are not available on the `Theme` but can still be accessed in typescript.

If you are using deprecated colors but require them in a typescript file you can import them directly:

```js
import { brandColors } from '@codecademy/styles';
```

For maintaining older `scss` code that we have not migrated yet, these color variables require you to add the import somewhere in your import tree. This will be necessary to import for all CSS Module style files.

```css
@import '@codecademy/gamut-styles/utils';

.standardRed {
  color: $color-blue;
}
```

### Brand Colors

These are old brand colors and still exist in many places while we try to deprecate them.

```js
import { brandColors } from '@codecademy/styles';
```

<DataTable {...TABLES.brand} />

### Deprecated Colors

These are the oldest colors we currently use, and are severely out of date.

```js
import { deprecatedColors } from '@codecademy/styles';
```

<DataTable {...TABLES.deprecated} />
