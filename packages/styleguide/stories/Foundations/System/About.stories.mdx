Many of our components are written in our CSS in JS library, [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/). we've created a set of style utilities that we call **System Props** to improve reusability, predictability, and standardization across our design system.

These functions are built with [`@codecademy/variance`](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut/tree/main/packages/variance): a library inspired by [`styled-system`](https://styled-system.com/) but with a focus on typesafety.
