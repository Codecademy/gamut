Many of our components are written in emotion our CSS in JS library. In order to improve resuability, predictability and standardization across our design system we've created a set of style utilities that we call **System Props**.

These functions are built with [`@codecademy/gamut-system`](https://github.com/Codecademy/client-modules/tree/main/packages/gamut-system) a library inspired by [`styled-system`](https://styled-system.com/) but with a focus on typesafety.
