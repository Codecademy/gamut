## Typefaces (`fontFamily`)

- Most of our designs use Aperçu Pro Bold, (Headlines, Titles) Regular (Paragraph Text, Menu Items, UI) or Italic (for emphasis)
- Do not use Aperçu Bold to emphasize text within a line/paragraph of Aperçu Regular
- Suisse Int’l Mono is used as an accent, in cases where items are listed/enumerated, for quotations, labels, and in other special cases.
- Suisse Int’l Mono reads quite large for its point size, and requires extra line-height in order to be readable as text. Styles have been adjusted to account for these features.
- Text should be left-aligned by default, using centering in some cases for Marketing emphasis or Interface specifics. You should never right-align text under normal circumstances

## Font sizes

- We use the term “Title” to distinguish our visual sizing from semantic designations like “H1”

## Line heights

- Line heights are limited to multiples of 4px
- Type boxes should be placed on the 8px placement grid like all other elements.

## Line Length

- Controlling line-length is necessary to ensure text is readable and are layouts well-ordered.
- For most multi-line text areas, keep lines to an average of 66 characters (including spaces).
- For multi-column layouts, do not exceed 50 characters per line (including spaces).
- The best way to control line-length is by starting with the appropriately sized text style for your design, then adjust the width / column-count of the type area until your lines fall within acceptable character counts.
