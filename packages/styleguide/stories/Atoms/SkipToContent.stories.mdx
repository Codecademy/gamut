  }}
/>

A hidden-by-default link that becomes visible when the user ~Tab~
s over it (gives it focus). This type of control is necessary for pages
that have a bunch of stuff keyboard users would have to Tab through to get
to the page's main content. It takes in the ID of the elemnt it scrolls to
and focuses ([dev.to article explaining why](https://dev.to/robdodson/managing-focus-64l))
To see it, keep tabbing around on this page.
