    subtitle: 'An invisible component to make pages more keyboard accessible.',
    source: 'gamut',
  }}
/>

A hidden-by-default link that becomes visible when the user <kbd>Tab</kbd>s over it (gives it focus).
It takes in the ID of the element it will scroll to and focus ([dev.to article explaining why](https://dev.to/robdodson/managing-focus-64l)) on click (via mouse or keyboard).

This type of control is necessary for pages that have a bunch of stuff keyboard users would have to Tab through to get
to the page's main content (like navigations).

For this component to work properly, there must be an element with the ID passed into this component and that element should have its `tabIndex` set to `-1`.
If there is a sticky header, you may have to set the z-index of this component so it is visible and you may have to offset the height of the header in the target element so it properly scrolls into view.

To see it, keep tabbing around on this page or visit [the catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript) and navigate via tab to see it in action.
