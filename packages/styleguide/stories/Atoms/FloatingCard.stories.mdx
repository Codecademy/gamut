## Usage Guidelines

- They have patterned drop shadow to indicate that are outside the normal document flow.
- This is a shared component for `Toast`, `Dialog`, and `Coachmark`; before using this component directly please check that these components do not cover your use case!
- `Tooltip` shares many styles with FloatingCards but is used more widely and does not have a shadow as that might detract from the critical functions it serves.

<Story name="Basic">
  <FloatingCard p={32}>We'll float on all right!</FloatingCard>
</Story>

<br />

## Beaks

FloatingCards can optionally display a beak. This is used to indicate a point of interest to the user - that the content of the card describes. Beaks are primarily used in `Coachmarks`.

<Story name="Beaks">
  {(args) => (
    <GridBox gridAutoFlow="column" columnGap={24} py={16}>
      {['bottom-left', 'bottom-right', 'top-left', 'top-right'].map((beak) => (
        <FloatingCard beak={beak}>{beak}</FloatingCard>
      ))}
    </GridBox>
  )}
</Story>
