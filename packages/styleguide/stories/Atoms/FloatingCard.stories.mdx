    source: 'gamut',

## Usage Guidelines

- Floating cards are generally used for components that are used outside the normal document flow. These Cards have a persistent shadow to make them obvious in relief.
- This is a shared component for `Toast`, `Dialog`, and `Coachmark`; before using this component directly please check that these components do not cover your use case!

<Story name="Basic">
  <FloatingCard p={32}>We'll float on all right!</FloatingCard>
</Story>

<br />

## Beaks

You may add a beak to the card

<Story name="Beaks">
  {(args) => (
    <GridBox gridAutoFlow="column" columnGap={24} py={16}>
      {['bottom-left', 'bottom-right', 'top-left', 'top-right'].map((beak) => (
        <FloatingCard beak={beak}>{beak}</FloatingCard>
      ))}
    </GridBox>
  )}
</Story>

<br />
