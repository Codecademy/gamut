## Usage

`ConnectedForm` is an organism designed to create flexible forms with all of the reliability of <LinkTo id='Organisms/GridForm'>GridForm</LinkTo> but without the strict grid structure.

### Components

- `ConnectedForm`: A <LinkTo id='Atoms/FormElements/Form'>Form</LinkTo> that provides context to all `Connected` components.
- `ConnectedFormGroup`: <LinkTo id='Atoms/FormElements/FormGroup'>FormGroups</LinkTo> that use the context provided by `ConnectedForm` for error and disabled states.
- `ConnectedFormInputs`: <LinkTo id='Atoms/FormInputs'>FormInputs</LinkTo> the use the context provided by `ConnectedForm` for field registration and validation as well as required and disabled states. Should be used through `ConnectedFormGroup`.
- `SubmitButton`: A submit type <LinkTo id='Atoms/Buttons'>Button</LinkTo> that uses the context provided by `ConnectedForm` for loading and disabled states.

### Utilities

The primary access pattern of `ConnectedForm` is the `useConnectedForm` hook which composes a typesafe version of `ConnectedForm` + `ConnectedFormGroup` from the `defaultValues` passed to it - catching errors before the development enviroment is even started.

Each of your fields' names must correspond with the appropriate `defaultValue` key. `validationRules` operates similarly - each key must correspond to a key in `defaultValue` and must follow [react-hook-form's](https://react-hook-form.com) [validation patterns](https://react-hook-form.com/v6/api#register).

This hook also returns the `FormRequiredText` component - include this before your form unless all of your form fields are optional.

### Example

<Canvas of={ConnectedFormStories.ConnectedFormPlayground} />

## Variants

### `watchedFields`

If you need the values of your inputs before submission, for something like conditionally generating different inputs, you can also pass in a `watchedFields` object. This takes in an array of names of fields to watch and a `watchHandler ` function which will be run `onChange` of your watchedField. This function should take an array of the return values of the inputs in the order the names are passed in to the `fields` props.

Watched fields aren't usually great for performance, so only use these fields when you need to.
