## Design principles

Recommended for engaging with individual Items

- Manage and open Items inside your List
- Expand the format of items to surface advanced layouts
- Include rich information and controls inside of each List Item

Customize Items with rich information

- Icons, graphics, complex layouts, other Atoms

Optional List-level interactions include

- Basic filtering and sorting across common attributes across Items

Be careful about placement and positioning

- Make sure Item controls are visible on the right
- Place Lists inside main containers to avoid overflow
- Use a Table if you have a design thatâ€™s meant to compare information between items

## Usage

Lists are one of the main design tools for displaying information in a structured / repeated way which are visually distinct from cards and functionally distinct from tables.

- Lists can function like tables, but aren't exclusively for displaying table data.
- Lists are distinct from Tables in that they have mixed column content (interactive elements / metrics) whereas tables have only metrics. If you plan on having row controls or options in your table, use a List.
- When presenting repetitive content prefer using a List view over a Card view.

### Sample code

```tsx
import { List, ListRow, ListCol } from '@codecademy/gamut';

<List variant="default" spacing="condensed">
  <ListRow>
    <ListCol size="md">Worf</ListCol>
    <ListCol size="md">Lieutenant Commander</ListCol>
  </ListRow>
  <ListRow>
    <ListCol size="md">Deanna Troi</ListCol>
    <ListCol size="lg">Commander</ListCol>
  </ListRow>
</List>;
```

## Spacing

Lists come with 3 spacing variants `normal`, `condensed`, and `compact`. For example:

```tsx
<List spacing="condensed" />
```

### Normal
For mixed content use the normal size to ensure that there is enough space for components.
<Canvas of={ListStories.NormalSpacing} />

### Condensed
To decrease the amount of spacing between rows, use the condensed spacing.

<Canvas of={ListStories.CondensedSpacing} />

### Compact
To provide the least amount of spacing between rows, use the compact spacing.

<Canvas of={ListStories.CompactSpacing} />


## Variants

Lists have several style variants for different use cases:

- `table`: Alternating backgrounds for visually separated rows of text.
- `default`: Bordered rows for mixed content with no vertical gutter.
- `card`: Bordered rows with a vertical gutter.
- `block`: Unbordered rows for mixed content with a vertical gutter..

```tsx
<List variant="default" />
```



### Default
For displaying things with more abstract row contents (like buttons or custom rendered components) use the `default` variant. This structure denotes borders between rows and separates interactive elements with more clarity than tables.

<Canvas of={ListStories.Default} />

### Card

For content that doesn't need to be compared or visually adjacent to other items in a list (like current curriculum progress) use the `card` variant.

<Canvas of={ListStories.Card} />

### Block

For making feature-forward designs (like our Dashboard), or to use as page sections + scaffolding (like our syllabus pages). The `block` variant should always be used on a colored background.

### Table

For a table like view for content that has more metrics or actionable data use the `table` variant.

<Canvas of={ListStories.Table} />

#### Ordered List
Our `List`s by default are the `ul` HTML element or unordered list. All of the above configurations works with ordered lists as well. Passing `ol` to the `as` prop will render an ordered list and add numbering to the rows.

Ordered lists should always have a one column with a `header` type row to ensure that the numbering is rendered correctly.

<Canvas of={ListStories.OrderedList} />

## Playground

If you are using a story named 'Default', you can forgo the `of` prop.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ListStories.Default} />
