## Overview

### Design principles

Recommended for engaging with individual Items

- Manage and open Items inside your List
- Expand the format of items to surface advanced layouts
- Include rich information and controls inside of each List Item

Customize Items with rich information

- Icons, graphics, complex layouts, other Atoms

Optional List-level interactions include

- Basic filtering and sorting across common attributes across Items

Be careful about placement and positioning

- Make sure Item controls are visible on the right
- Place Lists inside main containers to avoid overflow
- Use a Table if you have a design that's meant to compare information between items

### Usage

Lists are one of the main design tools for displaying information in a structured / repeated way which are visually distinct from cards and functionally distinct from tables.

- Lists can function like tables, but aren't exclusively for displaying table data.
- Lists are distinct from Tables in that they have mixed column content (interactive elements / metrics) whereas tables have only metrics. If you plan on having row controls or options in your table, use a List.
- When presenting repetitive content prefer using a List view over a Card view.

### Sample code

```tsx
import { List, ListRow, ListCol } from '@codecademy/gamut';

<List variant="default" spacing="condensed">
  <ListRow>
    <ListCol size="md">Worf</ListCol>
    <ListCol size="md">Lieutenant Commander</ListCol>
  </ListRow>
  <ListRow>
    <ListCol size="md">Deanna Troi</ListCol>
    <ListCol size="lg">Commander</ListCol>
  </ListRow>
</List>;
```

## Spacing

Lists come with 3 spacing variants `normal`, `condensed`, and `compact`. For example:

```tsx
<List spacing="condensed" />
```

### Normal

For mixed content use the normal size to ensure that there is enough space for components.

<Canvas of={ListStories.NormalSpacing} />

Here's an example of normal spacing in practice:

<Canvas of={ListStories.NormalSpacingGuide} />

### Condensed

To decrease the amount of spacing between rows, use the condensed spacing.

<Canvas of={ListStories.CondensedSpacing} />

Here's an example of condensed spacing in practice:

<Canvas of={ListStories.CondensedSpacingGuide} />

### Compact

To provide the least amount of spacing between rows, use the compact spacing.

<Canvas of={ListStories.CompactSpacing} />

### Combining with variants

You can combine variants and spacing to your needs. For example, here's a condensed table variant:

<Canvas of={ListStories.CondensedTableGuide} />

## Variants

Lists have several style variants for different use cases:

- `table`: Alternating backgrounds for visually separated rows of text.
- `default`: Bordered rows for mixed content with no vertical gutter.
- `card`: Bordered rows with a vertical gutter.
- `block`: Unbordered rows for mixed content with a vertical gutter..

```tsx
<List variant="default" />
```

### Default

For displaying things with more abstract row contents (like buttons or custom rendered components) use the `default` variant. This structure denotes borders between rows and separates interactive elements with more clarity than tables.

<Canvas of={ListStories.Default} />

### Card

For content that doesn't need to be compared or visually adjacent to other items in a list (like current curriculum progress) use the `card` variant.

<Canvas of={ListStories.Card} />

### Block

For making feature-forward designs (like our Dashboard), or to use as page sections + scaffolding (like our syllabus pages). The `block` variant should always be used on a colored background.

<Canvas of={ListStories.Block} />

### Table

For a table like view for content that has more metrics or actionable data use the `table` variant.

<Canvas of={ListStories.Table} />

#### Ordered List

Our `List`s by default are the `ul` HTML element or unordered list. All of the above configurations works with ordered lists as well. Passing `ol` to the `as` prop will render an ordered list and add numbering to the rows.

Ordered lists should always have a one column with a `header` type row to ensure that the numbering is rendered correctly.

<Canvas of={ListStories.OrderedList} />

## Columns

### Sizing

Column size can either be a fixed value (outline of the prop aliases `xs`, `sm`, etc.) or by the columns content width.
It is recommended that you use the aliases for any content that may have variable length to ensure that column sizing is consistent between each row. For column children that are static between each row - like buttons or truncated text you can specify `content` to remove white space and still render consistently between rows.

```tsx
// For example:
<ListCol size="md" />
```

Below is a List displaying the different sizes columns can be.

<Canvas of={ListStories.ColumnSizing} />

### Filling empty space

You can specify a column to expand or collapse beyond its normal flex basis. These modifiers can be used in conjunction with any size specification:

- `fill`: This fills any available space and pushes all other columns to the end of the row when specified.

<Canvas of={ListStories.FillingEmptySpace} />

### Justification

You can align the content to the right of each column using the `justify` prop on `ListCol`.

- Alternating between left and right justifications is not recommended, once you've switched to a right alignment any additional columns should also align to the right.
- You may want to also specify `fill` on one of the border columns to give space to the transition or use a larger column size.

<Canvas of={ListStories.Justification} />

## Advanced Features

### Layouts

#### Horizontal scrolling

If you have a list with many columns and would like to avoid collapsing any columns information you can use the `scrollable` prop which will lock the row header to the left hand side and expand all columns to the their minimum flex-basis. All rows and columns scroll along the X axis in tandem to ensure that you may compare data or take multiple actions between each row.

<Canvas of={ListStories.HorizontalScrolling} />

#### Responsive

List rows will switch to a mobile layout at screen widths less than smallest breakpoint (480px). This layout is built for smaller screens and is restructured to a card like structure. There is no extra configuration needed for this to take effect pending you've configured a few named column types:

- `header`: The column of the row with any critical identifying information goes at the top of the view. This is especially important for ordered lists as this is where the numbering will render.
- `control`: A column for buttons or other interactive elements. Typically these may be icon buttons with expandable menus with more options for controlling anything represented in the row. `List`s should only ever have one `control` column to prevent overlap on smaller screens.
- `content`: All other columns in the row are treated as content and will render in order they were specified.

Optionally, you can pass a `breakpoint` prop to the List to alter this behavior.

Adjust the size of your window to see how the List changes at different breakpoints.

##### Example configuration

```tsx
<List>
  <ListRow>
    <ListCol type="header">Header</ListCol>
    <ListCol>Content</ListCol>
    <ListCol type="control">
      <IconButton />
    </ListCol>
  </ListRow>
</List>
```

##### Container query control

By default, Lists use CSS container queries to determine responsive behavior based on the List's container width, rather than the viewport width. This allows Lists to adapt appropriately when placed in narrow sidebars or constrained layouts.

However, there are cases where you may want to disable container queries and rely on traditional media queries instead:

###### When to use `disableContainerQuery={true}`

- **Lists in containers already smaller than the breakpoint**: When your List is always rendered in a narrow container (like a 300px sidebar), container queries may not behave as expected
- **Lists with very few rows**: Short Lists with only 1-2 rows may not benefit from container query responsive behavior
- **Custom responsive management**: When you're implementing your own media or container query logic and want to avoid conflicts
- **Performance considerations**: In rare cases where container query support may impact performance
- **Legacy browser support**: When supporting browsers that don't have full container query support

###### Example usage

```tsx
// Disable container queries for a List in a narrow sidebar
<div style={{ width: '280px' }}>
  <List disableContainerQuery spacing="condensed">
    <ListRow>
      <ListCol type="header">Item</ListCol>
      <ListCol>Details</ListCol>
    </ListRow>
  </List>
</div>

// Use default container query behavior (recommended for most cases)
<List spacing="condensed">
  <ListRow>
    <ListCol type="header">Item</ListCol>
    <ListCol>Details</ListCol>
  </ListRow>
</List>
```

The example below demonstrates the difference between default container query behavior and disabled container queries:

<Canvas of={ListStories.DisableContainerQuery} />

**Note**: In most cases, you should use the default container query behavior as it provides better responsive design. Only disable container queries when you have specific layout requirements that conflict with the default behavior.

## Expandable

You can define collapsible content by passing an `expanded` prop and the `React.Node` to the `renderExpanded` prop of your `ListRow` components.

### Expand on button click

The `ListRow` component has access to the `ExpandControl` component which can be used to toggle the expanded state of the row. The `ExpandControl` component will automatically handle the rotation of the icon based on the expanded state.

```tsx
export const ExpandableRow: React.FC<{
  header: string;
  content: string;
  key: string;
}> = ({ header, content, key }) => {
  const [isExpanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);

  return (
    <ListRow
      key={key}
      expanded={isExpanded}
      renderExpanded={() => <Text>Surprise</Text>}
    >
      <ListCol type="header">{header}</ListCol>
      <ListCol type="content">{content}</ListCol>
      <ListCol type="control">
        <ExpandControl
          expanded={isExpanded}
          onExpand={() => setExpanded(!isExpanded)}
          disabled={false}
        />
      </ListCol>
    </ListRow>
  );
};
```

<Canvas of={ListStories.ExpandableButtonGuide} />

### Expand on row click

An entire row can be made interactive to expand the row content.

```tsx
export const ExpandableRow: React.FC<{
  header: string;
  content: string;
  key: string;
}> = ({ header, content, key }) => {
  const [isExpanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);

  return (
    <ListRow
      key={key}
      expanded={isExpanded}
      onClick={() => setExpanded(!isExpanded)}
      renderExpanded={() => <Text>Surprise</Text>}
    >
      <ListCol type="header">{header}</ListCol>
      <ListCol type="content">{content}</ListCol>
      <ListCol type="control">
        <Rotation rotated={isExpanded}>
          <ArrowChevronDownIcon color="text-disabled" />
        </Rotation>
      </ListCol>
    </ListRow>
  );
};
```

<Canvas of={ListStories.ExpandedRowGuide} />

## System props

List has access to the [space system props](https://gamut.codecademy.com/?path=/docs/foundations-system-props--docs#space) for controlling the spacing around the List component. These props can be used to control the margin and padding of the List.
