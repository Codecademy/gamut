## Text inputs

Text inputs support various HTML input types including `text`, `email`, `password`, `number`, `tel`, `url`, `search`, `date`, `time`, and more. All text inputs share the same basic properties but may have different validation patterns.

### Default value

### Placeholder text

Text inputs are allowed to have traditional `placeholder` text.
This is a somewhat dangerous behavior for accessibility, as browsers
generally don't render placeholder text with high enough color contrast
for AA standards. If you do need to use placeholder text, such as on
landing page forms that have been shown to have higher completion rates
with the text, please make sure the placeholder text doesn't add any new
information to the form -- it should really only rephrase the text label.

See [this article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/) or
more details on why using placeholders is often bad.

## Textarea input

## Radio group input

## File upload input

File upload fields allow users to select and upload files. You can add custom validation to restrict file types and sizes.

## Checkbox input

### Spacing

Checkboxes can use tight spacing when you need them to fit in smaller areas:

## Nested checkboxes input

Nested checkboxes allow for hierarchical selection with parent-child relationships between options. Infinite levels of nesting are supported. Clicking a parent checkbox toggles all its children accordingly. Individual child checkboxes can be toggled independently. Checkbox states are `checked` if all children are checked, `indeterminate` if some children are checked, or `unchecked` if no children are checked. The values returned by the form on submit or update are an array of all selected values, including all children.

## Custom inputs

Some forms, such as the checkout flows that use Recurly, need to define
their own inputs. We can specify a 'custom' field type to with a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

We also have a 'custom-group' type for when you are passing in a custom FormGroup - including a label. If you do not want GridForm to surface errors for your field, you should likely use a 'custom-group'. If you chose to go this route, please be aware of [accessibility best practices](https://www.deque.com/blog/anatomy-of-accessible-forms-best-practices/) for forms.

## Hidden input

Hidden inputs can be used to include data that users can't see or modify with the submission. For this implementation you can set the `defaultValue` in the object and it will be submitted with the regular form data.

## Sweet container input

"Sweet container" ([honeypot](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)>)) inputs can be used to detect bots by providing a field that would not generally be clicked by human users, but might be triggered automatically by bots.

We call it a "sweet container" so that bots do not immediately detect it as a honeypot input.
