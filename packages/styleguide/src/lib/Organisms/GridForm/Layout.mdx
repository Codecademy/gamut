## GridForm-atting

We can use the `size` and `rowspan` props (borrowed from <LinkTo id="layouts-layoutgrid--layout-grid">LayoutGrid</LinkTo>) to customize the layouts of our GridForms. You can also customize the `FormRequiredText` using the `requiredTextProps`. `FormRequiredText` should be spaced apart from or be stylistically different from the text element above it.

## `hideRequiredText`

`hideRequiredText` will hide the '\* Required' text that appears at the top of our forms. This should only be hidden if the form has no required fields.

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.HideRequiredText} />

## Solo field form

Solo field form should always have their solo input be required. They should automagically not have the required/optional text - if you have a custom rendered hidden input, you may have to use the `hasSoloField` prop.

## InfoTips

A field can include our existing `InfoTip`. See the <LinkTo id="molecules-tips-infotip">InfoTip</LinkTo> story for more information on what props are available.

See the <LinkTo id="atoms-forminputs-radio--radio">Radio</LinkTo> story for an example of how to add a infotip to a radio option.

## Sections

Our `GridForm`s optionally take an array of sections that have left and center-aligned variants.

Each sections should have a title that correctly follows [heading ranks](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/headings). You can set the text type of this title though the `as` prop on that section -- the default is `h2`. You can only set the `as` prop to a heading.

You can set the <LinkTo id="typography-text--variants">Text variant</LinkTo> prop for the section title the same way. Only title variants are reccomended, but if you need more granular control of the Text component, you can pass them into `titleWrapperProps`.

When using the left-aligned layout, please note that the `title` takes up 3 columns, so any field size over 9 may cause inconsistent behavior!
