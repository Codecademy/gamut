## Usage

The GridForm organism provides an easy, out-of-the-box way to implement forms from a list of fields. When provided a list of fields, GridForm strings together the appropriate <LinkTo id="Atoms/FormElements/About">Form Elements</LinkTo> inside a <LinkTo id="Layouts/LayoutGrid">LayoutGrid</LinkTo>.

GridForm provides the following benefits:

1. **Simplicity**: This organism takes in plain JSON-like props and uses them to string together a validated form
2. **Accessibility**: All GridForms handle accessibility styling and behaviors, passing tests out-of-the-box
3. **Functionality**: Validation and submission logic is handled by the [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com) library
4. **Visual Consistency**: Aligns all input elements with the correct vertical rhythms and grid spacing

## Designing with GridForm

All [Form Input](https://www.figma.com/file/ReGfRNillGABAj5SlITalN/%F0%9F%93%90-Gamut?node-id=1189%3A0) components in the Figma library are consistent with their implementations in code. By setting the form inputs within the component's layout grid, we can design forms that are compatible with Gamut.

The [GridForm page in Gamut](https://www.figma.com/file/ReGfRNillGABAj5SlITalN/%F0%9F%93%90-Gamut?node-id=1689%3A3910) also contains several starter templates for incorporating this organism in your designs.

- **Starter**: Contains sample components to begin creating your own form
- **Sections**: Contains the headers and dividers that are rendered in the optional Sections modules
- **Inline Submit**: A form incorporating the Inline Submit Button style of GridForm
- **Instructions**: Contains suggestions for modifying the Figma component for your own designs

### Figma component instructions

- Enable Layout Grid (^G)
- Select a `‚ùñ GridForm` variant as a template
  - Starter, Sections, Inline Submit
- Detatch the component to modify the `üìê LayoutGrid`
- Add, remove, and edit `‚¨¶ Form Inputs`
  - Input Field, TextArea, Checkbox, Radio Button, Select
- Customize `üö• GridFormButtons`
  - Submit button style (Fill/CTA), position, cancel button

## Customizations

### Disabled inputs

If an input is not meant to be usable, such as when a portion of a form is disabled pending user action, you can make it visually disabled with a `disabled` field member.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.DisabledInputs} />

### GridForm-atting

We can use the `size` and `rowspan` props (borrowed from <LinkTo id="layouts-layoutgrid--layout-grid">LayoutGrid</LinkTo>) to customize the layouts of our GridForms. You can also customize the `FormRequiredText` using the `requiredTextProps`. `FormRequiredText` should be spaced apart from or be stylistically different from the text element above it.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.Formatted} />

### Submit button position

We can position the submit button by passing the `position` prop with a
value of `'left'`, `'center'`, `'right'`, or `'stretch'`.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.SubmitButtonPosition} />

### Submit button options

We can specify the version of our button by passing the type prop. We can choose between
the <LinkTo id="atoms-button--fill-button">`FillButton`</LinkTo> or <LinkTo id="atoms-button--cta-button">`CTAButton`</LinkTo>.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.SubmitButtonOptions} />

### Inline submit button

We can make the Submit button inline with an input by setting the column
sizes so they fit on the same row (e.g size 8 for an input and size 4 for
the submit).

We can additionally remove the label from text inputs and checkbox inputs.
Use the `hideLabel` prop to remove the label, allowing the submit button to
align nicely with the input. **However**, if using `hideLabel` to remove the default label, you should provide an `aria-label` and/or include another label to the right/left of the input to ensure the input is accessible.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.InlineSubmit} />

### Cancel button

Optionally, include a cancel button.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.CancelButton} />

### Custom inputs

Some forms, such as the checkout flows that use Recurly, need to define
their own inputs. We can specify a 'custom' field type to with a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

We also have a 'custom-group' type for when you are passing in a custom FormGroup - including a label. If you do not want GridForm to surface errors for your field, you should likely use a 'custom-group'. If you chose to go this route, please be aware of [accessibility best practices](https://www.deque.com/blog/anatomy-of-accessible-forms-best-practices/) for forms.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.CustomInputs} />

### Placeholder text

Text inputs are allowed to have traditional `placeholder` text.
This is a somewhat dangerous behavior for accessibility, as browsers
generally don't render placeholder text with high enough color contrast
for AA standards. If you do need to use placeholder text, such as on
landing page forms that have been shown to have higher completion rates
with the text, please make sure the placeholder text doesn't add any new
information to the form -- it should really only rephrase the text label.

See [this article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/) or
more details on why using placeholders is often bad.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.PlaceholderText} />

### On field update

A field can take an onUpdate callback. This callback will fire when the
field's value changes. This could be useful if you need to use the
field's value in a parent component before onSubmit gets triggered.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.OnFieldUpdate} />

### InfoTip + GridForm

A field can include our existing `InfoTip`. The position of the infotip on each field is always set to the bottom-right.

See the <LinkTo id="atoms-forminputs-radio--radio">`Radio`</LinkTo> story for an example of how to add a infotip to a radio option.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.InfoTip} />

### Sections

Our `GridForm`s optionally take an array of sections that have left and center-aligned variants.

Each sections should have a title that correctly follows [heading ranks](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/headings). You can set the text type of this title though the `as` prop on that section -- the default is `h2`. You can only set the `as` prop to a heading.

You can set the <LinkTo id="typography-text--variants">Text variant</LinkTo> prop for the section title the same way. Only title variants are reccomended, but if you need more granular control of the Text component, you can pass them into `titleWrapperProps`.

When using the left-aligned layout, please note that the `title` takes up 3 columns, so any field size over 9 may cause inconsistent behavior!

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.Sections} />

### Custom error

A field can take a custom error in addition to validation errors. The validation error will always take precedence to the custom error.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.CustomError} />

### Hidden input

Hidden inputs can be used to include data that users can't see or modify with the submission. For this implementation you can set the `defaultValue` in the object and it will be submitted with the regular form data.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.HiddenInput} />

### Sweet container input

"Sweet container" ([honeypot](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)>)) inputs can be used to detect bots by providing a field that would not generally be clicked by human users, but might be triggered automatically by bots.

We call it a "sweet container" so that bots do not immediately detect it as a honeypot input.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.SweetContainer} />

### Markdown errors

GridForm renders errors through our <LinkTo id="atoms-markdown--basics">Markdown</LinkTo> component so we can optionally add markdown to our validation messages.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.MarkdownErrors} />

### `<ColorMode />`

By toggling dark mode you can see all the colors map to a new color that is accessible for the mode by default. Please use the ColorMode control on the top of this page and navigating to the Playground example to check it out!

**Note**: you **cannot** use the deprecated 'business' button type with `ColorMode`.

### Checkbox spacing

If you need to checkboxes to fit into a smaller space, you can use our our `tight` spacing prop for checkboxes that are a bit closer together.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.CheckboxSpacing} />

### Loading and disabled states

You can set the state of the submit button to `loading` as `true` to show a loading spinner. This is useful when you need to show the user that the form is submitting.
You can also set `disabled` to `true` to disable submission.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.LoadingAndDisabled} />

### Disabled fields on submit

`disableFieldsOnSubmit` will disable all form fields once the form has been successfully submitted. If you have any server-side validation that needs to happen, we recommend using the `wasSubmitSuccessful` prop, but submission will also fail if a promise is rejected within your `onSubmit` or if a field does not pass validation.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.DisabledFieldsOnSubmit} />

### Reset form on submit

`resetOnSubmit` will reset the form once the GridForm has been successfully submitted. If you have any server validation that needs to happen, we recommend using the `wasSubmitSuccessful` prop, but submission will also fail if a promise is rejected within your `onSubmit` or if a field does not pass validation.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.ResetOnSubmit} />

We can combine these together to create some pretty cool forms which have a loading state, disable their fields while submitting, and reset the form when the submit was successful.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.FormLoading} />

### `hideRequiredText`

`hideRequiredText` will hide the '\* Required' text that appears at the top of our forms. This should only be hidden if the form has no required fields.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.HideRequiredText} />

### Solo field form

Solo field form should always have their solo input be required. They should automagically not have the required/optional text - if you have a custom rendered hidden input, you may have to use the `hasSoloField` prop.

<Canvas of={GridFormStories.SoloField} />
