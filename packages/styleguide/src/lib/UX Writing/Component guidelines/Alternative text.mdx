Alternative text, or alt text, is a short written description of an image that helps users make sense of the image when it canâ€™t be viewed. Alt text is read by screen readers, search engines, and is displayed in browsers upon hover or when an image file is unable to load.

## Best practices

Writing alt text is pretty straightforward, but here are some best practices to keep in mind:
- There's no need to use "picture of" or "image of" language. Screen readers will announce the image as an image.
- Be descriptive. Alt text should provide all of the information the image is being used to convey.
- Use alt text for non-decorative images. Decorative image alt text can be left out since they don't add useful context.
- Images with text should not be used. If it can't be avoided, be sure to use the same text in the alt text as is displayed on the image.

## Checklist
* Is alt text included for all non-decorative images on the page?
* Does your alt text provide all the information a user needs to understand what the image is being used to convey?
