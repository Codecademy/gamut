Buttons enable our learners to "speak" to us. They click to tell us what they want (i.e. to "Start my free trial" or to "Resume learning") and we respond with the anticipated next step.

## Best practices

When approaching writing buttons — whether they're text buttons, fill buttons, or call-to-action buttons — here are a few things to keep in mind:

- **Be specific.** People should know exactly what they're getting when they click on a button. If a button leaves you questioning what will happen when you click on it, adjust the copy to make it more clear. Specificity also plays a big role in ensuring accessibility for learners navigating our content with screen readers.
- **Use action-oriented language.** Start with an action-oriented verb rather than simply listing where the button will take you (i.e. Use "Take the quiz" instead of "Language quiz").
- **Emphasize the value people get, rather than how they get it.** When relevant, focus on the benefit/what people are receiving instead of the way they are receiving it. For instance, instead of "Download for free" try "Get the free guide."
- **When in doubt, A/B test!** Buttons — specifically call-to-action (CTA) button copy can have a major impact on conversion. If you're undecided about which CTA is best, test — especially for high-impact projects.

### Fill buttons

- **Length:** Keep to a maximum of 3 words (unless more words are necessary for clarity).
- **Capitalization:** Use sentence case, capitalizing only proper nouns.

### Text buttons

- **Length:** Keep to a maximum of 3 words (unless more words are necessary for clarity).
- **Capitalization:** Use sentence case, capitalizing only proper nouns.
- **Arrow usage:** Include → after the text when clicking brings users to a new surface. There should always be a space between the text and the arrow.

### CTA buttons

- **Length:** Keep to a maximum of 3 words (unless more words are necessary for clarity).
- **Capitalization:** Use sentence case, capitalizing only proper nouns.

## Checklist

- For buttons, is your copy 3 words or less?
- For buttons, have you used action-oriented language?
- Have you used sentence case, only capitalizing proper nouns?
- Does the copy make it clear where the button will take learners?
