Buttons enable our learners to "speak" to us. They select buttons to tell us what they want (for example, to **Try pro for free** or to **Resume learning**), and we respond with the anticipated next step.

## Best practices

When approaching writing buttons — whether they're text buttons, fill buttons, or call-to-action buttons — here are some things to keep in mind:

- **Be specific.** People should know exactly what they're getting or what happens next when they select a button. If a button leaves you unsure, adjust the copy to make it more clear. Specificity also plays a big role in ensuring accessibility for learners navigating our content with screen readers.
- **Use action-oriented language.** Start with an action-oriented verb rather than simply listing where the button will take you.\
  Example: use **Take the quiz** instead of "Language quiz"
- **Emphasize the value people get**, rather than how they get it.\
  Example: **Try Pro for free** instead of "Opt in"
- **Use the established system patterns** for navigational and purely functional buttons.\
  Examples: **Next**, **Back**, **Close**
- **Use the same word to refer to the same thing** to foster trust and prioritize clarity.\
  Examples: **Go to payment**, **Complete payment**, **Cancel payment**
- **Avoid using pronouns** on the actual button because in the micro-interaction, the speaker can be either Codecademy or the learner.\
  Example: **Go to dashboard**, not "Go to your dashboard" or "Go to my dashboard"
- **When in doubt, A/B test!** Buttons, specifically call-to-action (CTA) button copy, can have a major impact on conversion. If you're undecided about which CTA is best, test — especially for high-impact projects.

## Checklist for writing button labels

- Does the copy make it clear where the button will take learners?
- Does the button lead with an actionable verb?
- Is the microcopy 3 words or less (especially for the primary button)?
- Have you used sentence case, only capitalizing [proper nouns in the **Codecademy glossary**](https://skillsoftdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UXW/database/4447175693?savedViewId=9b4c57a9-0cfb-42b0-97c5-08a87e8a2c84)?
