## The 4 principles of accessibility

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the Internet's main international standards organization. W3C maintains a set of guidelines for web accessibility. The most up-to-date version of W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines is [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines contain 4 principles for creating accessible content. Understanding these 4 principles is key to understanding how to write accessible content.

### 1. Perceivable

Information on-screen must be perceivable to blind, deaf, low-vision, or color-blind learners.

- Include meaningful and unique alt text for all non-decorative images or icons
- Don't rely on visuals for words to make sense
- If text is meant to be read, include it as text and not an image
- Include captions for video and audio content

### 2. Operable

Content should be easy for users to navigate and find what they're looking for. Touch and click targets should be easy to hit and content should be accessible with a screen reader.

- Make hyperlink text long enough that it's easy to hover over and click
- Use meaningful, unique, and descriptive CTAs
- Avoid ambiguous link text like "Click here" or "Read more"
- If more than one label contains the same text, clarify with screen-reader-only text
- Write so that labels, tooltips, and input fields appear in a logical order
- Avoid directional language like "above" or "below"
- Ensure users have enough time to read text

### 3. Understandable

Content should be easy to understand. Plus, it should appear and operate in predictable ways.

- Use H1, H2, H3 headings correctly and consistently ([Learn more about headings](https://www.notion.so/Headings-be907c4d24c84dffb970cedc3ee54936))
- Check to ensure copy is at a 7th-grade reading level or below
- Use short, clear sentences and paragraphs
- Avoid jargon, slang, and idioms
- Expand acronyms on first use
- Use list formatting when appropriate

### 4. Robust

- Write in a way that's platform-agnostic (i.e. select or choose vs. tap or click)

### Bonus: Meaningful

You'll find the word "meaningful" used a lot in guidance for writing for accessibility. So we're taking the opportunity to throw in a quick definition of what we mean when we use it.

Meaningful text is useful text. It provides the full context a user needs to understand a situation.

Meaningful alt text describes what's important about an image a user can't see. Meaningful button text clearly where a link will go. It avoids ambiguous standalone phrases like "click here" or "read more."

## Accessible content checklist

### Alt text
- Is alt text included for all non-decorative images on the page?
- Does your alt text provide all the information a user needs to understand what the image is being used to convey?

### Buttons
- Is CTA text meaningful? Is it clear where clicking will take the user?
- If there is more than one button on the page, is the text for each button unique?
- If each button is not unique, have you provided screen-reader-only text to clarify?

### Headings
- Does your page include a single, unique H1 title?
- Are H2 and H3 headings used correctly and consistently?



### Hyperlinks
- Is link text meaningful? Is it clear where clicking will take the user?
- Are hyperlinks long enough (2-3 words) to be easy to click on?
- If there is more than one hyperlink on the page, is the text for each link unique?
- If each hyperlink is not unique, have you provided screen-reader-only text to clarify?


### Imagery
- Do all non-decorative images or icons contain[alt text](https://skillsoftdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/265f8fcabee0479ea6841c6b0b7e2171/pages/4440883349/Alternate+alt+text)?
- Does the alt text provide all the information a user needs to understand what the image is being used to
- Are all words understandable without reliance on imagery?


### Readability
- Do users have enough time to read the text?
- Is your copy at a reading level of grade 7 or below? Test with [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com).
- Are sentences and paragraphs short and clear?
- Is your content free of jargon, slang, and idioms?
- Have you used list formatting when appropriate?
- Do users have enough time to read the text?

### Screenreader compatibility
- Does text appear in chronological order?
- Are headings used correctly and appropriately?
- Have you avoided directional language (i.e. "the form on the right" or "in the section below")?
- Is the language platform-agnostic?
- Have you passed the buttons, headings, hyperlinks, imagery, and readability checklists?


### Video and audio content
- Are captions included for all audio and video content?
- For video, do the captions match what's happening on-screen?
