Gamut components, styles, and utilities are the core of the Codecademy brand shared across its websites.
They're most notably used on [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com) but are also found on our internal websites and tools, as well as on our mobile application.

This storybook represents components found in the Codecademy [Client Modules](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut) repo.

Its organization roughly aligns with variations of [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
