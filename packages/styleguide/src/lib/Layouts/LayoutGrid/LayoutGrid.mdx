## Usage

`LayoutGrid` is a flexible grid that can support arbitrary rows of content, each of
which snaps to assuming 12 "units" of width. Cells in the rows are
stored as a `Column` that have a grid-specified gap
between them.

Row and column gaps can be configured in a responsive way. For example, you might
have a particular set of gaps at small viewports and bigger ones on large viewports.

### Best practices:

- Use `LayoutGrid` to create a flexible grid for full-page layouts.

### When NOT to use:

- Use `FlexBox`, `GridBox`, or `Box` for containing smaller areas of the page.

## Props + Variants

### Grid gaps

Grid gaps are the space between cells both horizontally and vertically.
If you would like to adjust the space between columns, set the `columnGap`.
If you would like to adjust the space between rows, set the `rowGap`.
Both these properties can take a "CASS TO DO LINK" responsive size, allowing you to define gaps at each breakpoint.

### Row height

You can add row height to you by setting the `rowHeight` prop. This will set the height of each row in the grid.

<Canvas of={LayoutGridStories.RowHeight} />

### Offsets

Columns may be offset from the left by numbers within the [0-12] scale.
As with column and row gaps, those numbers may be static or responsive.

### Rowspans

Columns may be span multiple rows. Make sure you have a consistent row height when using rowspans.
