## As a user

### Search

The search bar is located at the top left of the page, right below the Gamut icon. It allows you to quickly find stories, components, and documentation. You can search by component name, story name, or relevant keywords.

<ImageWrapper
  src="./meta/search.png"
  alt="The search bar at the top of the page."
  height="auto"
/>

### Toolbar

On each page is a toolbar located on the top:

<ImageWrapper
  src="./meta/toolbar.png"
  alt="The Storybook toolbar, detailed below."
  height="auto"
/>

1. Grid (the 2x2 collection of squares) - applies a grid to the preview
2. Color mode selector (the circle icon) - toggles between light and dark mode for rendered code examples
3. Theme switcher (the paintbrush icon) - switches between different design system themes (Core, Admin, LX Studio, Percipio)
4. Outline (dotted square) - applies outlines to elements in the rendered code examples

### Theme Switcher

The theme switcher (paintbrush icon) allows you to preview how components look across different design system themes. This is particularly useful for:

- **Designers**: Comparing how components appear in different brand contexts
- **Developers**: Testing component compatibility across themes
- **QA**: Ensuring components work correctly in all supported themes

Available themes:

- **Core**: The base design system theme used across most Codecademy properties
- **Admin**: Specialized theme for administrative interfaces
- **LX Studio**: Theme for the LX Studio learning platform
- **Percipio**: Theme for the Percipio platform

The theme switcher works in combination with the color mode selector, so you can test both light and dark variants of each theme.

### Showing code

On the bottom right of each canvas (a rendered code example) is a button to show its code:

<ImageWrapper
  src="./meta/show_code.png"
  alt="a button on the bottom right of the canvas to show the code being rendered."
  height="auto"
/>

When clicked, it will show the code used to render the example:

<ImageWrapper
  src="./meta/shown_code.png"
  alt="the code used to render the example shown below the canvas."
  height="auto"
/>

If the code shown is obfuscated into a component that doesn't show the entirety of the code, it may be helpful to navigate to the [Gamut repository](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut) to find the corresponding `.stories.tsx` file that contains the code for the example.

For instance, you might see a canvas that shows it's rendering `<SuperCoolFillButtonExample />`, but you want to know all the props that go into making this instance of the `FillButton`. In this case, you can navigate to the `FillButton.stories.tsx` file in the Gamut repository to see the code that renders this example. If you need further assistance, you can always reach out to the Gamut team via the Gamut slack channel.

### Playground + Controls

At the bottom of a component story is a canvas that shows a robust example of how the component can be used. Connected to this canvas is a set of controls that allow you to change the props of the component in real-time. This is useful for testing different configurations of the component without needing to write any code.

<ImageWrapper
  src="./meta/playground_controls.png"
  alt="the controls used to interact with the example shown below the canvas."
  height="auto"
/>

### Individual canvas

All canvases can be isolated by clicking on the link with the canvas's name in the side bar. For example, here are the canvases for the `Badge` component:

<ImageWrapper
  src="./meta/sidebar_canvases.png"
  alt="the sidebar showing the individual canvases for the Badge component."
  height="auto"
/>

By default you'll be on the "Docs" tab, which shows the component's documentation. You can click on any of the options below it to see the individual canvases for that component. This will bring you to a sandbox where you'll have an expanded toolbars menu, the rendered component instance itself, and controls to manipulate the instance.

<ImageWrapper
  src="./meta/individual_canvas.png"
  alt="the individual canvas for the Badge component."
  height="auto"
/>

## As a developer

### Common errors

If you see an error in Storybook that says "Error fetching `/index.json`:" — it may be an actual error where the page is trying to render a story that does not exist.

Double check that the name of the story in the `stories.tsx` file matches the name of the canvas's `of` prop in the `.mdx` file.

If you've confirmed that the story names match up, you can try deleting the `<Canvas of={...} />` line in the `.mdx` file and re-adding it. This will force Storybook to re-render the canvas and may resolve the issue.
Otherwise, you may need to restart your server to fix the issue.

### When to `yarn build`

When making changes to `/gamut-icons`, `/gamut-illustrations`, or `/gamut-patterns`, you should run `yarn build` to ensure that your changes are reflected in the built output.

### JSX in `.mdx` files

You can use JSX in `.mdx` files, but this is not recommended. If you need to include JSX, you should be adding it to the `.stories.tsx` file and then rendering inside a canvas in the `.mdx` file.

There are several reasons for this:

- Linting isn't as supported in the `.mdx` file, so you may not catch errors in your code, e.g. props might not be typed correctly
- It can make the `.mdx` file harder to read and maintain
- Storybook can find it difficult to parse, e.g. rogue whitespaces can cause the whole page to not render

### Adding new stories

Follow the <LinkTo id="Meta/Stories">Stories</LinkTo> page to add new stories to the styleguide. This will ensure that your stories are properly formatted and follow the conventions used in the styleguide.

### Exposing component code

When writing a story in the `.stories.tsx` file, you can export the component as a `Story` or a `React` component:

```tsx
export const StoryExample: Story = {
  args: { ... },
}

// OR

export const StoryExample: Story = {
  args: { ... },
  render: (args) => <ComponentName {...args} />,
}

// OR

export const ComponentExample: React.FC = (args) => (
  <ComponentName {...args} />
);
```

These exported components can then be used in the `.mdx` file to render the component in a canvas.
Each export type displays code differently in the "Show code" section of the canvas, so you can choose the one that best fits your needs.

<Callout
  text={
    <>
      If you need to create a complex example and still want to show the code,
      you might want to export it as a React component.
    </>
  }
/>

### When in doubt, ask!

If you're unsure about how to use a component or how to write a story, you can always reach out to the Gamut team via the Gamut slack channel (#gamut-team). There is a schedule rotating between Gamut team members who are on-call to help answer or triage questions.
