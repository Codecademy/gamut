## How can I contribute?

Thanks for your interest! 🙌

We are prepared to accept contributions from Codecademy employees only at this time, but we are working on a process to accept contributions from the wider community. Watch this space!

## To Gamut or not to Gamut?

> When should we create a general component in Gamut instead of a specific one in another application?

In general, we prefer Gamut components to be those that are commonly shared across multiple experiences in the monolith.
If something can be easily built from the existing primitives _without_ adding logic, we generally wouldn't make a special component for it.

Some examples of things we'd generally include in Gamut are:

- Common visually identifiable atoms, such as buttons or form inputs
- Atoms linked together with client logic, such as an Alert bar

Some examples of things we generally wouldn't include are:

- Customized atoms specially designed for a particular use case, such as promotional "cards"
- Groups of components that could be recreated easily, such as a particular button and grid combination

Consider referencing other design systems such as [Fluent](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent) and [Material Design](https://material.io/design) to see what they choose to turn into generic components.

### Implementation strategy?

> Should we implement components in separate repositories or in Gamut?

As general rules of thumb:

1. If a component is being written for the first time or used for a second time:

   - If the designer thinks it might belong in Gamut, feel free to implement it in the separate repository
     - Consider making its API simple and flexible _(e.g. passing props to it instead of hooking it up to Redux)_
   - If the designer doesn't intend for it to be in the design system, never mind Gamut

2. If a component is being used for a third time or more, please discuss moving it to Gamut

## What's going on with accessibility?

Codecademy is committed to becoming [WCAG 2.2 accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag), and technical accessibility is a must-have in our design system. Components added here are expected to be fully AA compliant.
