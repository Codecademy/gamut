<AboutHeader {...parameters} />

This guide covers how to reference code elements, UI components, file paths, and commands consistently throughout documentation. Following these conventions ensures clarity and maintains a professional, accessible tone across all Gamut documentation.

## Code in Text

- Use backticks for inline code: `onClick`, `flex-direction`, `Box`, `StrokeButton`, `variant`, backgroundColor`, etc.
- File and package names: `Button.tsx`, `package.json`, `@codecademy/gamut`
  - Unless you're linking to them, in which case use permalinks
- Values assigned for props or variables: `true`, `15px`, `null`
- "The `Box` component" (first mention) → "the component" (subsequent mentions)
- When plural, the component should stay singular and the “component” is the pluralized, e.g
  - ✅ “These `Box` components are…”
  - ❌ “These `Boxes` are…”

## Code samples

Code samples help developers understand how to implement components and patterns. Use them to demonstrate real-world usage, not just syntax.

### Format:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@codecademy/gamut';
export const Example: React.FC = () => (
  <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
);
```

### Guidelines:

- Include necessary imports
- Use realistic, working examples
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep examples focused on one concept
- Use TypeScript types

## Command-Line syntax

When documenting commands, use consistent formatting to make them easy to copy and execute. Commands should be ready to run without modification.

### Format:

```bash
yarn add @codecademy/gamut-kit
```

### Guidelines:

- Use shell (`sh`) syntax highlighting for commands
- Don't include command prompt symbols ($, #)
- Show one command per block unless related

## File Paths

- Use backticks for file paths: `packages/gamut/src/Button/index.tsx`
- Use relative paths when contextual (e.g., `./types.ts`)
- Use paths from workspace root when further clarity is needed (e.g., `packages/gamut/src/Button/index.tsx`)
- Use "in" for code locations: "in the `componentName.mdx` file"

## UI element references

When instructing users to interact with the interface, clearly identify what the UI elements are, where to find them, and how to interact with them.

### Format:

- Bold for UI labels: **Next**, **Back**, **Close**
- Describe location: "Click the **Theme Switcher** (paintbrush icon)"
- Use sentence case: "the **Show code** button"
- Prefer words that aren't specific to input devices
  - Use "click" as a device agnostic verb
- Avoid directional language:
  - ✅ "the following/adjacent form" or "in the previous section"
  - ❌ "the form on the right" or "in the section above"
