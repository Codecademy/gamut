## Prework

We track planned work for Gamut components in the [Gamut Board](https://skillsoftdev.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/GM/boards/784) on JIRA.

- If there's a ticket there you want to take on, send a Slack to #gamut-team or come to Gamut Office hours and lets talk about it!
- If the work you'd like to do isn't captured in a JIRA ticket, talk to us and we can work with you to create that ticket.
- If you would like to make a request for work to be done, please discuss with us on Slack or during Gamut Office Hours.
- If you'd like to pitch a change to the design system, please attend Gamut Crit, come to Gamut Office Hours, or send a Slack message to #gamut-team.

## Writing components

### Component structure

Create your component as an `index.tsx` file in a PascalCase-named folder within its package directory, such as `packages/gamut/src/ProgressBar/index.tsx`.
Consider saving this recommended format as an editor snippet:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

export type MyComponentProps = {
  /* ... */
};

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = (
  {
    /* ... */
  }
) => {
  // ...
};
```

#### Props documentation

With the exception of widespread, self-documenting props such as `onClick`, please include a sentence cased description of the prop's intent.
React props on the component will be picked up by Storybook and added to the component's documentation story.
We prefer these be full sentences.

```ts
/**
 * Number of lines to limit the message to.
 */
limit: number;
```

- If your comment purely restartes the name and type of variable, please either elaborate on it or remove the comment altogether.
- Consider starting comments for booleans with _"Whether "_.

### Unit tests

Your component should have unit tests in a `__tests__/MyComponent-test.tsx` file within its directory.
Use `setupRtl` from `gamut-tests` to test it.

We generally try to unit test all component logic, with the exception of class names in components that contain other logic.

### Stories

All components must have Storybook stories showing their use. See <LinkTo id='Meta/Stories'>Stories</LinkTo> for documentation.

## Pull requests

Please fill out the pull request template, including links to the corresponding Abstract design and JIRA ticket.

<Callout

      to just run CI jobs. That includes deploying a Netlify preview and
      publishing alpha package versions to npm. 😉
    </>
  }
/>

### Publishing updates

If you know your PR has breaking changes in at least one downstream repository, such as the [codecademy-engineering/mono](https://github.com/codecademy-engineering/mono):

1. Before merging it, create PRs in those downstream repositories using your PR's published alpha package versions
2. Verify those PRs work as expected and get them signed off normally
3. Merge your Gamut PR
4. Wait until the new Gamut package is published, then update the downstream repository PRs to use it
5. Merge and deploy those PRs as soon as possible

If your PR contains breaking changes that might affect other users, please mention them in the `#frontend` Slack channel.
