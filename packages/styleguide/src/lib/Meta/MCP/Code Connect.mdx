<Callout text="Code connect files, `*.figma.tsx` files are already created for Gamut components, you should NOT need the CLI to help generate these files." />

Much of the following information is extracted from the [Figma Code Connect documentation](https://www.figma.com/code-connect-docs/) — it's been adapted to fit the context of this repository.

Code Connect provides Figma with the actual code for Figma components. In providing accurate code, this helps the Figma MCP generate accurate code snippets for designs that use these components.

<Callout text="Any changes to Code Connect files should be requested through the Gamut team and NOT done on an individual or a separate team." />

## Installing the Code Connect command line tool

To install the Code Connect command line tool, run the following command:

```bash
npm install --global @figma/code-connect@latest
```

## Download the Figma desktop client app

If you haven't already, download the Figma desktop client app appropriate for your OS by going to https://www.figma.com/downloads/.

### Generate your personal access token

Through the desktop app:

1. Click on the Figma icon in the top left-hand corner
2. Select "Help and Account" > "Account Settings" — this should open a modal
3. In the modal, select the "Security" tab
4. Locate the section "Personal access tokens" and click "Generate a new token" and provide a descriptive name (e.g., "Gamut Repository MCP")

This token should have permissions for:

- Code Connect: "Write"
- File content: "Read-only"

After your token is generated, copy it somewhere safe. Upon closing the modal, you won't be able to see it again.

More information can be found in [Figma's access token documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens).

## Editing Code Connect files

In `packages/code-connect`, you'll find `*.figma.tsx` files. These files are Code Connect files that map Figma components to Gamut components.

If you are creating a new Gamut component, you should create a new `*.figma.tsx` file in this directory and follow the existing patterns to map your component.

Use the [Code Connect CLI documentation](https://www.figma.com/code-connect-docs/) to help you understand how to map Figma properties to React props.
