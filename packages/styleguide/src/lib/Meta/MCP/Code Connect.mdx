Code Connect provides Figma with the actual code for Figma components. In providing accurate code, this helps the Figma MCP generate accurate code snippets for designs that use these components.

More information can be found at [Figma Code Connect documentation](https://www.figma.com/code-connect-docs/)

<Callout text="Any changes to Code Connect files should be requested through the Gamut team and NOT done on an individual or a separate team." />

## Code Connected components

When visiting the Figma file, you'll know if a component is set up with Code Connect if you select the component and see the sidebar includes a "Code Connect" section.

  alt="A Figma component, Badge, with the Code Connect sidebar open."

### Exploring behavior

For components with Code Connect, you can also click on the "Explore behavior" button to open a modal that allows you to edit the component's props. Editing these props will automatically update the code in the modal's Code Connect section to give you a sense of how to adapt your component accordingly.
