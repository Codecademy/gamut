Much of the following information is extracted from the [Figma Dev Mode MCP documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Dev-Mode-MCP-Server) — it's been adapted to fit the context of this repository.

## Installing the Code Connect command line tool

To install the Code Connect command line tool, run the following command:

```bash
npm install --global @figma/code-connect@latest
```

## Figma (desktop client app)

If you haven't already, download the Figma desktop client app appropriate for your OS by going to [Figma's download page](https://www.figma.com/downloads/).

### Start up local Figma MCP server

1. Click on the Figma icon in the top left-hand corner
2. Preferences > Enable local MCP server

## Set up MCP Client for your text editor/IDE

We currently support MCP for VSCode and Cursor. Please let the Gamut team know if you'd like support for other editors.

### VSCode

There is an `mcp.json` file that is already configured, you do not need to do anything else.

### Cursor

1. Open Cursor → Settings → Cursor Settings.
2. Go to the MCP tab (might be called MCP & Integrations) from the left-hand sidebar.
3. Under "MCP Tools", click "+ Add MCP server".
4. Enter the following configuration and save:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Figma": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

To check if your MCP server is running, you can visit the endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`. You should see a response, e.g.: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32001,"message":"Invalid sessionId"},"id":null}`.
Yes, it's an odd response, but it indicates that the MCP server is running — otherwise if it's not running you'll see an error "This site can’t be reached" on the page.

Similarly you can test the end point using:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp
```

## (Optional) Check the rules

In this repo, there are rules for Copilot (VScode) and Cursor to use the Figma MCP server. You can find them in `.github/instructions/figma.instructions.md` and `.cursor/rules/figma-rules.mdc` respectively.

## Prompt your MCP client

You can prompt the MCP in two main ways:

1. Provide a link to the node of the design you'd like to generate code for, e.g.:

   > Generate the code for this node: https://www.figma.com/design/ReGfRNillGABAj5SlITalN/%F0%9F%93%90-Gamut?node-id=79202-13690&m=dev

2. Selecting the node in the Figma interface, e.g.:
   > Generate the code for the current selection

In the chat, you may be prompted to allow the Figma commands like `get_code()` to run.

## Feedback for the Gamut team

Please let the Gamut team of any feedback you have, things like:

- If you find that a new rule that you'd like implemented in this repo, please let the Gamut team know.
- Support for another text editor/IDE.
- Incorrect code generation

If you have any other feedback or suggestions, feel free to share those as well!
