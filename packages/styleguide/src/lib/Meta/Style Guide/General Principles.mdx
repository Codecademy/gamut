## Voice and Tone

- Friendly and conversational: Write as if explaining to a colleague
- Direct and action-oriented: Use "you" to address readers
- Encouraging without overpromising: Be supportive but realistic
- Global audience awareness: Avoid idioms, slang, and culturally-specific references

## Inclusivity

- Use inclusive language that makes all contributors feel welcome
- Avoid jargon unless necessary — define terms when first introduced
- Write for accessibility — ensure screen readers can parse content
- Consider contributors of varying experience levels and roles (designers and developers)

## Transparency

- Clearly indicate component status:
  - `current`: Stable, recommended for use
  - `updating`: In progress, API may change
  - `deprecated`: Do not use for new work
  - `static`: Reference material, no active development
- Link to source code and design files (Figma, GitHub)
- Direct contributors to help channels (#gamut-team, Office Hours)

## Consistency

- Use the same terminology throughout documentation
- Match language between headings, body copy, and code examples
- Maintain consistent component naming across packages
- Follow established patterns from existing components
