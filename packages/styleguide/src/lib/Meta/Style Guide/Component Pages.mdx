## Using a single MDX file

For components that have pages that aren’t too long, use the component-doc shortcut to auto-populate a template to describe the component’s usage, best practices, variants, examples, etc.

## Using a directory of MDX files

We recommend using a directory when a component is complex — in this case, “complex” can mean many things:

- it has multiple variants, usages, behaviors (e.g. GridForm)
- it is made of different subcomponent (e.g. Menu)
- it serves as a base component for other components (e.g. Button)

Directories must include an About page. The contents of the About.mdx file can be generated using the toc-story shortcut that generates a template — this template will prompt you to include the general idea of what the collective files entail and a Table of Contents linking to individual pages.

## Rendered code examples

Examples rendered via `<Canvas of={componentName.example} />` are stored in the componentName.stories.tsx file.

When providing an example, use concretely applicable values. Avoid naming things like foo or bar, instead be opt for values that could be used in a practical setting, e.g. if deciding on the name of a boolean variable, don’t use isBar — instead, consider the setting the example could be used, isModalOpen.

When a user clicks **Show Code**, Storybook tries to show the underlying code, but Storybook is not good with abstractions. Instead of opting to be DRY, each example should contain all the code to render and when a user clicks on **Show Code**, they should be able to copy the code provided and render in their own project.

```
// ❌ Don’t abstract the logic into an InfoTipExample
export const Default: Story = {
 render: (args) => <InfoTipExample {...args} />,
};
```

```
// ✅ Provide the actual code
export const Default: Story = {
  render: (args) => (
    <FlexBox center m={24} py={64}>
      <Text mr={4}>Some text that needs info</Text>
      <InfoTip {...args} />
    </FlexBox>
  )
};

```

## Comments in code

- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Keep comments concise
- Explain "why" not "what"
- Use comments to highlight important patterns
