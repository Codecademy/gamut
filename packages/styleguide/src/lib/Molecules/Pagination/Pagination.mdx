## Usage

Use this component to navigate between content that is split across multiple pages.

## Types

We have two types of pagination - `basic` and `includeSkipToButtons`. The `basic` type has number as well as forward and back buttons. The `includeSkipToButtons` type also features an ellipsis button which allows users to quickly jump through page numbers by `chapterSize` as well as the first and last page buttons.

For any pagination that is longer then 10 pages, the `includeSkipToButtons` type is the default.

### `basic`

<Canvas of={TemplateStories.Default} />

### `includeSkipToButtons`

<Canvas of={TemplateStories.IncludeSkipToButtons} />

## Variants

We have two variants of pagination - `stroke` and `text` - that roughly correspond to our **Buttons** with some Pagination-specific style overrides.

### `stroke`

<Canvas of={TemplateStories.Stroke} />

### `text`

<Canvas of={TemplateStories.Text} />

## Pagination navigation

When using pagination as navigation between linked pages, use the `isNavigation` prop. Your `onChange` function should include programmatic navigation.

<Canvas of={TemplateStories.Navigation} />

## Controlled pagination

When `pageNumber` is specified, the component switches to being a controlled component.

<Canvas of={TemplateStories.Controlled} />

## Playground

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={TemplateStories.Default} />

<Controls />
