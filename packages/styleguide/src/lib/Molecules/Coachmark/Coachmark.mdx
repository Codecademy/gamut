## Usage

Use `Coachmark` to guide learners about key functionality on a page or drive new feature adoption.

### Best practices:

- Provide guidance that introduces a new feature or explains a complex interaction.
- Use coachmarks sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user.

### When NOT to use:

- Long-term guidance or instructions should be provided in a more permanent location, such as a help center or documentation.

## Guidance

The `Coachmark` component should be wrapped around the element you want to highlight. What a user sees is comes from `renderPopover` which is a function with an optional `onDismiss` argument that returns a React node. `Coachmark` uses its child element as a target for the `Popover`.

```jsx
const ExampleCoachmark = () => {
  const [shouldShow, setShouldShow] = useState(true);

  const renderPopover = (onDismiss) => (
    <Box >
      <Text>This is the Popover</Text>
      <FillButton
        onClick={() => {
          setShouldShow(false);
          onDismiss();
        }}
      >
        Click to un-show the Coachmark's Popover!
      </FillButton>
    </Box
  );

  return (
    <Coachmark
      renderPopover={renderPopover}
      shouldShow={shouldShow}
    >
      <FillButton onClick={() => setShouldShow(true)}>Child element that triggers Coachmark</FillButton>
    </Coachmark>
  );
};
```

### `shouldShow`

A `Coachmark` can be set to show or hide based on the `shouldShow` prop. This is useful for controlling when the popover appears. For example, you might want to show the popover only in special circumstances, such as when a user first visits a page or not show again after they click a specific button.

<Canvas of={CoachmarkStories.Default} />

### `delay`

The `delay` prop allows you to control how long the popover will wait before showing. This is useful for ensuring that the user has time to interact with the target element before the popover appears.

This example has a delay of 3000 ms (3 seconds) between clicking the button and the popover appearing.

### `skipFocusTrap`

The `skipFocusTrap` prop allows you to disable the focus trap that is normally applied to the popover. `skipFocusTrap` defaults to `true`, which means that the popover will not trap focus. However, if you need to to enable the focus trap you can set `skipFocusTrap` to `false` .

### `popoverProps`

Using `popoverProps`, you can customize the look of the rendered popover. For example, you can add an outline, beak, and pattern, as shown below.

<Canvas of={CoachmarkStories.Customized} />

### Z-Index

You can customize the `zIndex` of the Coachmark's popover by passing `zIndex` through `popoverProps`. This is useful when the popover needs to appear above other positioned elements.
