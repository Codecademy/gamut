## Usage

Use a Modal to create a dialog on sits on top of a full screen overlay.

## Customizing close behavior

### Creating a custom close button

By default, the Modal will render a close button.
You can disable the default close button with the `hideCloseButton` prop by setting it to false.
You can then use the `isOpen` prop to create other controls that toggle the Modal on and off.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.CustomClose} />

### Alternative closing methods

Other than creating buttons that can close the Modal, there are other ways a Modal can be closed by the user.

1. Clicking the content outside of the Modal
2. Clicking the escape key on their keyboard

All of these methods default to `true` for accessibility reasons, and rely on setting the required `onRequestClose` prop and making sure it toggles the `isOpen` prop on the Modal.

## Size variants

### Fluid

Setting the `size` to `'fluid'` will make the width of the Modal fit its content.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Fluid} />

### Large

A Modal with `size` `'large'` has a width of `680px` and a minimum height of `310px`.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Large} />

### Medium

A Modal with `size` `'medium'` has a width of `540px` and a minimum height of `240px`.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Medium} />

### Small

A Modal with `size` `'small'` has a width of `400px` and a minimum height of `170px`.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Small} />

## Scrollable

A Modal can be made scrollable by including large content inside.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Scrollable} />

## Multiple views

A single Modal can be used to navigate between different content within itself.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.MultipleViews} />

## Adding an image

The `image` prop can be used to include a full-width product image or illustration with a 16:9 aspect ratio. This image should help clarify the message of the modal.

Overflow for images will be cut off, so make sure the image is correctly sized for the modal.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.WithImage} />

## Playground

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ModalStories.Default} />
