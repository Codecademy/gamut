<Meta of={OverlayStories} />

<ComponentHeader {...parameters} />

## Usage

Use this overlay only for actual 'overlay' content that takes up the full screen. Do not use it for dropdowns or other small interactive items.

Unlike the legacy `Modal` implementations in the monolith, this:

- always assumes viewport is locked, by making content `position: fixed`
- cannot override contentProps, animation, or shouldFocusOnMount.

### When NOT to use:

- If you need styles such as a background behind content, see `Modal` for general modals and `Dialog` for confirmation flows.

## Playground

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={OverlayStories.Default} />

<Controls />
