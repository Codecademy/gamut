## Usage

Use a Disclosure to progressively reveal information, giving users the option to access additional details as needed. By initially hiding less immediately relevant information, it minimizes cognitive load and boosts content scannability.

### Best practices:
- When there is large amount of information that all users might not need to see, but some users might want to see, use a Disclosure to hint at the additional information and allow users to expand it.


### When NOT to use:
- If you need to use multiple Disclosures, use the <LinkTo id="organisms-disclosure">List</LinkTo> component component with `<ExpandableRowClick>` for the time being.

## Variants
Disclosure has 3 variants for background color (`'default'`, `'subtle', 'transparent'`), a state of `hasBorder` to render a 1px solid black border, and 3 spacing options (`'normal'`, `'condensed'`, `'compact'`). Check the Figma design to apply the correct styling.

### Background and border variants

<Canvas of={DisclosureStories.Default} />
<Canvas of={DisclosureStories.SubtleBgBordered} />
<Canvas of={DisclosureStories.Transparent} />
<Canvas of={DisclosureStories.HasBorder} />

### Spacing options

`spacing` is an optional prop you can pass to `<Disclosure>`. By default it's set to `"normal"`, though you can set it to `"condensed"` or `"compact"` as well. Spacing will determine the height of the heading, the size of the chevron icon, as well as the padding of both the heading and the body.

<Canvas of={DisclosureStories.Normal} />
<Canvas of={DisclosureStories.Condensed} />
<Canvas of={DisclosureStories.Compact} />
