## Usage

Use tabs when you have multiple potential sections to show, but only one should be visible at a time.
The set of tabs should be sections of related content that share the same structure and are of equal importance.

## Variants

### Uncontrolled

By default, the `Tabs` component is uncontrolled, meaning it will maintain its own state and switch between the different `TabPanel` components without passing any data to the component. This is good for basic use-cases where you don't need to do anything "extra" when switching tabs.

The `Tabs` component will automatically select the first tab if no `defaultSelectedKey` is provided. You can use `onSelectionChange` in uncontrolled tabs for things like click tracking, but if doing so make sure you pass in a `defaultSelectedKey` otherwise the click tracking will run twice.

### Controlled

`Tabs` can be controlled using the `selectedKey` prop, paired with the `onSelectionChange` prop. The `id` prop from the selected tab will be passed into the callback when the tab is selected, allowing you to update state accordingly.

### Adding a Badge

`Tabs` can use the <LinkTo id="Atoms/Badge">Badge</LinkTo> component to display a status, e.g. indicate new or updated content.

<Canvas of={TabStories.WithBadge} />

### Block variant

If you set `variant='block'`, you will get a slim, dark mode version of `Tabs`.

### Tab navigation

You can also use tabs as standard link-based navigation. To do this, you can use the `TabNav` and `TabNavLink` components.

It is recommended to add a unique `aria-label` to the `TabNav` component, to differentiate it from other navigation elements on the page.

### Tabs with interactive content

Normally, when you navigate to the contents of a `TabPanel` using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key or arrow keys, the entire section of the `TabPanel` will be in focus.

However, if you have tabs with interactive content within them (such as a button or link), and tab into the `TabPanel`, the focus will be on the interactive content and not the entirety of the `TabPanel`.

### Disabled

You can disable a tab by passing the `isDisabled` prop to a specific `Tab` component. Or by passing an array of tab keys that should be disabled to the `disabledKeys` prop of the `Tabs` component.
