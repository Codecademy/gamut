## Usage

Use tabs when you have multiple potential sections to show, but only one should be visible at a time.
The set of tabs should be sections of related content that share the same structure and are of equal importance.

## Variants

### Uncontrolled

By default, the tabs component is uncontrolled, meaning it will maintain it's own state and switch between the different `TabPanel` components without passing any data to the component. This is good for basic use-cases where you don't need to do anything "extra" when switching tabs.

<Canvas of={TabStories.Default} />

### Controlled

Tabs can be controlled using the `selectedKey` prop, paired with the `onSelectionChange` prop. The `id` prop from the selected tab will be passed into the callback when the tab is selected, allowing you to update state accordingly.

<Canvas of={TabStories.Controlled} />

### Adding a Badge

Tabs can use the Badge component to display a status, e.g. indicate new or updated content.

<Canvas of={TabStories.WithBadge} />

### Block variant

If you pass in the variant 'block', you will get a slim, dark mode version of tabs.

<Canvas of={TabStories.BlockVariant} />

### Tab navigation

You can also use tabs as standard link-based navigation. To do this, you can use the `TabNav` and `TabNavLink` components.

It is recommended to add a unique `aria-label` to the `TabNav` component, to differentiate it from other navigation elements on the page.

### Tabs with interactive content

If you have tabs with interactive content within them (such as a button or link), the interactive content, rather than the TabPanel itself, will become focused.

<Canvas of={TabStories.InteractiveContent} />

### Disabled

You can disable a tab by passing the `isDisabled` prop to the `Tab` component, or by passing an array of tab keys that should be disabled to the `Tabs` component. This will prevent the tab from being selected and will also grey it out.

<Canvas of={TabStories.Disabled} />
