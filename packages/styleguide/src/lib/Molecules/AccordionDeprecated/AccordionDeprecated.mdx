## Usage
**Note**: This component is deprecated. For similar functionality, consider using Disclosure(ADD LINK HERE) or a List(ADD LINK HERE) component.

Use in conjunction with the AccordionButtonDeprecated component to create an accordion-style interface.

This Accordion component will fit to `100%` of the the height of their parent container. If you need a fixed height container, wrap the accordion in a `<div>`.

### Best practices:
- Avoid unless necessary for legacy pages that rely on this component. Check with a designer to ensure that styling is consistent or if it could be upgraded to use an updated component.

### When NOT to use:
- [Having a button that reveals additional information]- for creating a single "Accordion", similar to an HTML [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element, use the Disclosure component instead.
- Creating a "Accordion" with many rows â€” akin to an FAQ that lists out questions and reveals an answer when clicked, use the List component with expandable rows.

## Variants

### AccordionAreaDeprecated

If you'd like a "controlled" component equivalent, you can manually use the `AccordionAreaDeprecated` and `AccordionButtonDeprecated` sub-components. In these cases, you'll need to manage the state of the `expanded` prop yourself. The example provided always shows the accordion expanded.

Most accordions should use an `AccordionButtonDeprecated`; other forms of buttons are acceptable for custom accordions.
