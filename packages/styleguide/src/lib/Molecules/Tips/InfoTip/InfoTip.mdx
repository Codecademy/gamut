## Usage

A tip is triggered by clicking on an information icon button and can be closed by clicking outside, pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>, or clicking the info button again.

Use an infotip to provide additional info about a nearby element or content.

Infotip consists of an icon button and the .tip-bg subcomponent. The info button has low and high emphasis variants and the `.tip` has 4 alignment variants.

## Variants

### Emphasis

The InfoTip has high and low emphasis variants.

### Alignments

InfoTips have four different alignment options: `top-right`, `top-left`, `bottom-right`, and `bottom-left`. They have a consistent size and are meant for longer content. If you need a smaller, more concise component checkout (the upcoming) ToolTip or Link Preview components to see if they fit your use case.

### Placement

InfoTips sometimes need to be in used in a way that they need to escape the confines of their parent container. The `floating` variant of the `placement` prop allows InfoTips do just this. (Notice how this section doesn't need as much padding because the InfoTips are able to escape their context!)

This `floating` variant should only be used as needed.

## Keyboard Navigation & Accessibility

### InfoTips with links or buttons

Links or buttons within InfoTips should be used sparingly and only when the information is critical to the user's understanding of the content. When an InfoTip opens, focus automatically moves to the tip content, allowing keyboard users to immediately interact with any links or buttons inside.

### Automatic Focus Management

InfoTips automatically manage focus for optimal keyboard accessibility:

- **Opening**: Focus automatically moves to the tip content when opened
- **Tab (Floating)**: Navigate forward through focusable elements (links, buttons) inside the tip. When reaching the last element, wraps back to the InfoTip button
- **Shift+Tab (Floating)**: Navigate backward naturally - from the button, exits to the previous page element (no backward trap)
- **Tab/Shift+Tab (Inline)**: Follows normal document flow
- **Escape**: Closes the tip and returns focus to the InfoTip button

### Global Escape Key Handling

InfoTips listen for the Escape key globally and will close automatically **unless** a higher-priority element is open:

- **InfoTips close on Escape** regardless of where keyboard focus is
- **Modals and dialogs take priority** - InfoTips detect when `dialog[open]`, `role="dialog"`, or `role="alertdialog"` elements are present and defer Escape handling to them
- After closing a modal, pressing Escape again will close the InfoTip
- When an InfoTip closes via Escape, focus automatically returns to the InfoTip button

## Custom Accessible Label

The InfoTip button label can be customized using the `ariaLabel` prop. This is useful when the default "Show information" label doesn't provide enough context.

## InfoTips and zIndex

You can change the zIndex of your `InfoTip` with the zIndex property.
