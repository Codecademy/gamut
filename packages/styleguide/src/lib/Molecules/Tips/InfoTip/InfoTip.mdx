## Usage

A tip is triggered by clicking on an information icon button and can be closed by clicking outside, pressing <KeyboardKey>Esc</KeyboardKey>, or clicking the info button again.

Use an infotip to provide additional info about a nearby element or content.
The info button has low and high emphasis variants and the `Tip` has 4 alignment variants.

## Variants

### Emphasis

The InfoTip has high and low emphasis variants.

### Alignments

InfoTips have four different alignment options: `top-right`, `top-left`, `bottom-right`, and `bottom-left`. They have a consistent size and are meant for longer content. If you need a smaller, more concise component checkout (the upcoming) ToolTip or Link Preview components to see if they fit your use case.

### Placement

InfoTips sometimes need to be in used in a way that they need to escape the confines of their parent container. The `floating` variant of the `placement` prop allows InfoTips do just this. (Notice how this section doesn't need as much padding because the InfoTips are able to escape their context!)

This `floating` variant should only be used as needed.

## Keyboard navigation & accessibility

### InfoTips with links or buttons

Links or buttons within InfoTips should be used sparingly and only when the information is critical to the user's understanding of the content. When an InfoTip opens, focus automatically moves to the tip content, allowing keyboard users to immediately interact with any links or buttons inside.

### Automatic Focus Management

InfoTips automatically manage focus for optimal keyboard accessibility:

- **Opening**: Focus automatically moves to the tip content when opened
- ** <KeyboardKey>Tab</KeyboardKey> (Floating)**: Navigate forward through focusable elements (links, buttons) inside the tip. When reaching the last element, wraps back to the InfoTip button
- **<KeyboardKey>Shift </KeyboardKey> + <KeyboardKey>Tab</KeyboardKey> (Floating)**: Navigate backward naturally - from the button, exits to the previous page element
- **<KeyboardKey>Tab/Shift+Tab</KeyboardKey> (Inline)**: Follows normal document flow
- **<KeyboardKey>Escape</KeyboardKey>**: Closes the tip and returns focus to the InfoTip button

### InfoTips with Modals and Dialogs

InfoTips have intelligent Escape key handling that works correctly both inside and outside Modals:

- **InfoTips close on <KeyboardKey>Esc</KeyboardKey>** regardless of where keyboard focus is, and focus returns to the InfoTip button
- **InfoTips inside Modals close first** - When an InfoTip is placed inside a Modal, pressing <KeyboardKey>Esc</KeyboardKey> closes the InfoTip while keeping the Modal open
- **Layered navigation** - After closing an InfoTip inside a Modal, pressing <KeyboardKey>Esc</KeyboardKey> again closes the Modal
- **Modals take priority over external InfoTips** - InfoTips detect when `dialog[open]`, `role="dialog"`, or `role="alertdialog"` elements are present and defer <KeyboardKey>Esc</KeyboardKey> handling to them when the InfoTip is outside the Modal

## Custom Accessible Labeling

Provide either `ariaLabel` or `ariaLabelledby` to ensure screen reader users understand the purpose of the InfoTip button.

The InfoTip button's accessible label can be customized using either prop:

- **`ariaLabel`**: Directly sets the accessible label text. Useful when you want to provide a custom label without referencing another element.
- **`ariaLabelledby`**: References the ID of another element to use as the label. Useful when you want the InfoTip button to be labeled by visible text elsewhere on the page. This is useful for when the `InfoTip` is beside text that contextualizes it.

### Custom Role Description

The `InfoTipButton` uses [`aria-roledescription`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-roledescription) to provide additional context to screen reader users about the button's specific purpose. This defaults to `"More information button"` but can be customized via the `ariaRoleDescription` prop for translation or other accessibility needs.

## InfoTips and zIndex

You can change the zIndex of your `InfoTip` with the zIndex property.
