## Usage

A tip is triggered by clicking on an information icon button and can be closed by clicking outside, pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>, or clicking the info button again.

Use an infotip to provide additional info about a nearby element or content.

Infotip consists of an icon button and the .tip-bg subcomponent. The info button has low and high emphasis variants and the `.tip` has 4 alignment variants.

## Variants

### Emphasis

The InfoTip has high and low emphasis variants.

### Alignments

InfoTips have four different alignment options: `top-right`, `top-left`, `bottom-right`, and `bottom-left`. They have a consistent size and are meant for longer content. If you need a smaller, more concise component checkout (the upcoming) ToolTip or Link Preview components to see if they fit your use case.

### Placement

InfoTips sometimes need to be in used in a way that they need to escape the confines of their parent container. The `floating` variant of the `placement` prop allows InfoTips do just this. (Notice how this section doesn't need as much padding because the InfoTips are able to escape their context!)

This `floating` variant should only be used as needed.

## InfoTips with links or buttons

Links or buttons within InfoTips should be used sparingly and only when the information is critical to the user's understanding of the content. If an infotip _absolutely requires_ a link or button, it needs to provide a programmatic focus by way of the `onClick` prop. The `onClick` prop accepts a function that calls the object `{isTipHidden}` and should focus when the tip is visible.

## InfoTips and zIndex

You can change the zIndex of your `InfoTip` with the zIndex property.
