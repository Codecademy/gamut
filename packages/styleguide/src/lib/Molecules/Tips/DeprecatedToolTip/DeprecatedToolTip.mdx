## Usage

**Note:** This component is deprecated and should not be used in new designs.

Display a small piece of extra information triggered on the focus or hover of a button or icon, such as extra requirements for a form surfaced from an informative (i) icon.

Tooltip contents are generally small pieces of text or other non-interactive information.
They disappear when the focus or hover are no longer active.

> If you'd like interactive contents, use a <LinkTo id="Molecules/Popover">Popover</LinkTo>.

### Best practices:

- Great for surfacing additional information that may or may not be relevant _without_ cluttering the core interface.

### When NOT to use:

- If you'd like interactive contents, use a <LinkTo id="Molecules/Popover">Popover</LinkTo>
- [use case]- for [describe the use case], use the [similar component] component.

## Alignment

Tooltips can be aligned both horizontally and vertically relative to their target.
The caret tip will be centered horizontally on the target.

### Smaller Alignments

Tooltips with _centered_ alignments -`bottom-center` or `top-center`- are smaller sized and meant for a single small number of words, like keyboard shortcuts.

_Note:_ Because of the size of these ToolTips, they should never overflow their container so are not applicable to Tooltips with the 'floating' `placement`.

### Larger Alignments

Tooltips with _corner_ alignments -`*-left` or `*-right`- are larger sized and meant for the occasional longer explanation, like form field validation explainers.

## Focusable

ToolTip targets are often buttons or other natively focusable elements.

If the target is not focusable, such as for plain text or icons, use the `focusable` prop so keyboard users can still trigger the ToolTip.

## Placement

Tooltips sometimes need to be in used in a way that they need to escape the confines of their parents container. The `floating` variant of the `placement` prop allows ToolTips to do just this. (Notice how this section doesn't need as much padding because the ToolTips are able to escape their context!)

## Playground

Tooltips can be of a `dark` or `light` visual mode. Swap the ColorMode in our toolbar at the top of the page to see them in action!

## UX writing

Writing a tooltip? Keep it short, useful, and avoid sharing information that’s vital for learners to complete tasks. Refer to the checklist below for guidance. For more tips and best practices, check out the full guide about <LinkTo id="ux-writing-component-guidelines-tooltip">writing for tooltips</LinkTo>.

- Only add a tooltip if the information is actually useful.
- Avoid redundancy to information already available on screen.
- Don’t hide information learners need to complete a task in a tooltip.
- Don’t include links in tooltips. They aren’t accessible to screen readers.
- Keep copy at a reading level of grade 7 or below. Test with [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/).
- Ask someone unrelated to the project to read the message to see if it makes sense.
