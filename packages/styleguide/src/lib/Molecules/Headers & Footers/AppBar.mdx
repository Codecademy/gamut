<Meta of={AppBarStories} />

<ComponentHeader {...parameters} />

This is an example of an AppBar component that contains one left-oriented AppBarSection that holds one AppBar Tab.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={AppBarStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

## Header

This is an example of how our headers use the AppBar component to format various sections in a bar (left, center, and right). The AppBar can hold as many AppBarSections as you'd like.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={AppBarStories.Header} />
</Canvas>

### Note

This AppBar is an updated version of AppBarDeprecated, which relies on `.scss` and `classNames` for styling.
