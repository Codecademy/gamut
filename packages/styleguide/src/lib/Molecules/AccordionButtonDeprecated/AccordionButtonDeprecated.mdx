## Usage
**Note**: This component is deprecated. For similar functionality, consider using Disclosure(ADD LINK HERE) or a List(ADD LINK HERE) component.

Use AccordionButtonDeprecated in conjunction with the AccordionDeprecated component to create an accordion-style interface.

### Best practices:
- Avoid unless necessary for legacy components that rely on this. Check with a designer to ensure that styling is consistent or if it could be upgraded to use an updated component.

### When NOT to use:
- [Having a button that reveals additional information]- for creating a single "Accordion", similar to an HTML [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element, use the Disclosure component instead.
- Creating a "Accordion" with many rows â€” akin to an FAQ that lists out questions and reveals an answer when clicked, use the List component with expandable rows.

## Variants

### Blue

Blue AccordionButtonDeprecated tops are only usable in dark contexts, such as the LE's Help Menu.

<Canvas of={AccordionButtonDeprecatedStories.Blue} />

### Plain

Plain AccordionButtonDeprecated tops are best applied in plain pages such as marketing pages where we haven't been able to invest yet in a more solid theme.

<Canvas of={AccordionButtonDeprecatedStories.Plain} />

### Yellow

Yellow AccordionButtonDeprecated tops are used in the "Get a Hint" sections of the LE's narrative pane.
