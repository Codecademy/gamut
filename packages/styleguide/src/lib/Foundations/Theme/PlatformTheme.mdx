The Platform Theme is a theme used within the Codecademy Learning Environment. It is built off of the Core Theme with special colors for the Learning Environment. See <LinkTo id="Forundations/Theme/CoreTheme">Core Theme</LinkTo> for more information on the theme object and how to use it.

## Color

**Key**: `platformTheme.colors`

All current visual identity colors are available on the `colors` key on the Theme object, this includes named standard colors and their respective swatches.

### Standard colors

Standard color atoms we select from in creating designs. All colors on Codecademy properties should adhere to these. Remember your accessibility contrast requirements too!

### Solid color swatches

Swatch colors are accessible with a dashcase key `theme.colors['${color}-${weight}']`. Here's a list of all the solid swatches available.

## Color modes

We have 2 core color modes that we support: `light` and `dark`.

Each color mode consists of a set of aliased color tokens. Each alias has semantic meaning for how the color is used throughout our design system:

- `text`: The standard text color for all type.
- `background`: The base background color.
- `primary`: The color used for interactive elements with a primary action.
- `secondary`: The color used for interactive elements with a secondary action.

For more on Color Modes please checkout the [full color mode documentation](/?path=/docs/foundations-colormode--page)
