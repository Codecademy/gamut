<AboutHeader {...parameters} />

We've created several color modes by default for light and dark context.

Each color mode consists of a set of aliased color tokens. Each alias has semantic meaning for how the color is used throughout our design system:

- `text`: The standard text color for all type.
- `background`: The base background color.
- `primary`: The color used for interactive elements with a primary action.
- `secondary`: The color used for interactive elements with a secondary action.

**Note**: This set is not final and is likely to expand as our needs grow.

Gamut components are built using these aliases instead of referring to specific tokens directly, guaranteeing that:

- Components can be used in ANY context without configuration and work correctly.
- Consistent color scheme and accessibility between contexts.
- Colors usage more meaningful when reading through code as aliases hint to usage.
- Dead simple configuration.

### Light mode

<LightModeTable />

### Dark mode

<DarkModeTable />

## `<ColorMode />`

Here's an example using components in context. By toggling dark mode you can see all the colors map to a new color that is accessible for the mode by default.

<ColorModeExample />

### Usage

```tsx
import { ColorMode } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

const Page = ({ children }) => (
  <ColorMode mode="light">{children}</ColorMode>;
);
```

### `system` Color Mode

You can also provide `ColorMode` with `mode="system"` and it will automatically set the color mode based on the users preference.

<SystemColorModeExample />

### Usage

```tsx
import { ColorMode } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

const Page = ({ children }) => (
  <ColorMode mode="system">{children}</ColorMode>;
);
```

## `<Background />`

There are many cases where you may need a specific background color for a section of a page, like a card or a landing page. Instead of having to guess the right mode for the background, we've added a `<Background />` component to detect if contrast of the background and current mode's text color meet an accessible standard. If not, we will automatically change the mode to an accessible one, allowing you to be sure that all components inside your background will meet contrast requirements and designs without any configuration!

### Current background

When you use `Background` the selected background color is set to a theme variable `background-current`. This is useful to reference when you need access to an ancestors background color (e.g. simulating transparency + masking content).

### Usage

```tsx
import { Background } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

const Page = ({ children }) => (
  <Background bg="hyper">{children}</Background>;
);
```

## `useCurrentMode` | `useColorMode`

For situations where you need to access the current mode in JS, the value of always present on the emotion theme context. If you need the full theme you may use the built in `useTheme` hook from `@emotion/react`. However for cases that are specific to modes only we expose 2 hooks to help.

- `useColorMode()`: If you need access to all modes and their variables this hook will return a tuple of `[mode, modeColors, modes]`.
- `useCurrentMode()`: For simpler usages where you want to get the default mode, this hook returns the key of the active mode.

```tsx
import { useColorMode, useCurrentMode } from '@codecademy/gamut-styles';

const [current, currentColors, modes] = useColorMode();

const current = useCurrentMode();
```

### Examples

Sometimes you may just want to wrap a page in a different background color than the base color mode.

<BackgroundExample bg="hyper" />

<BackgroundExample bg="beige" />

In some cases you may want to use multiple areas with different backgrounds. `<Background />` makes this a simple task by provisioning a new color context for all components inside.

<BackgroundExample bg="black">
  <BackgroundExample bg="paleGreen" />
</BackgroundExample>

<BackgroundExample bg="navy-900">
  <BackgroundExample bg="white-500" />
</BackgroundExample>

<BackgroundExample bg="green">
  <BackgroundExample bg="white-500" />
</BackgroundExample>

## `usePrefersDarkMode`

If you want to check which color mode the user prefers, you can use `usePrefersDarkMode` and it will return a boolean value using `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia).
