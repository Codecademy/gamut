## Usage

FocusTrap is a wrapper around the [react-focus-on](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on) library, so any necessary functionality that provides should be exposed through this component. If necessary, you can pass props directly to `react-focus-on` through the `focusOnProps` prop.

## Playground

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={FocusTrapStories.Default} />

<Controls />
