import { Canvas, Controls, Meta, Story } from '@storybook/blocks';

import { ComponentHeader } from '~styleguide/blocks';

export const parameters = {
  subtitle: `An invisible component to make pages more keyboard accessible.`,
};

<Meta of={SkipToContentStories} />

<ComponentHeader {...parameters} />

## Usage

Use `<SkipToContent />` to add a hidden-by-default link that becomes visible when the user <kbd>Tab</kbd>s over it (gives it focus).
It takes in the ID of the element it will scroll to and focus ([dev.to article explaining why](https://dev.to/robdodson/managing-focus-64l)) on click (via mouse or keyboard).

This type of control is necessary for pages that have a bunch of stuff keyboard users would have to Tab through to get
to the page's main content (like navigations).

For this element to work properly, there must be a `<SkipToContentTarget />` component with the id passed into this component. The `<SkipToContentTarget />` component by default has a `tabIndex` of -1.

To see it, keep tabbing around on this page or visit [the catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript) and navigate via tab to see it in action.

## Playground

<Canvas sourceState="shown">
  <Story of={SkipToContentStories.Default} />
