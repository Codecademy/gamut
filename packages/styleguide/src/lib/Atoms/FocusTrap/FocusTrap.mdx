  subtitle: "Used for modal and dialog experiences like `Overlay` and `ModalDeprecated`, this component controls focus management behavior when we need to limit focus to a single area of the page for some amount of time. It doesn't need to be a modal or overlay, and can instead be controlled with the `active` prop.",

<Meta of={FocusTrapStories} />

<ComponentHeader {...parameters} />

## Usage

FocusTrap is a wrapper around the [react-focus-on](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on) library, so any necessary functionality that provides should be exposed through this component. If necessary, you can pass props directly to `react-focus-on` through the `focusOnProps` prop.

## Playground

<Canvas sourceState="shown">
  <Story of={FocusTrapStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

<Controls />
