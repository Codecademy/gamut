## Usage

Use `FeatureShimmer` to subtly draw attention to secondary new features or elements that are are important for the user to notice, though not the primary focus of the page.

### Best practices:

- Only apply `FeatureShimmer` to a single element at a time to avoid overwhelming the user.
- Set a reasonable limit for how often the shimmer appears, such as up to 3 times or until the user interacts with the element.
- Disable for users with reduced motion settings enabled.

### When NOT to use:

- Primary Features — For main features or critical updates, use more prominent indicators like the <LinkTo id="Molecules/Coachmark">Coachmark</LinkTo> or <LinkTo id="Atoms/Badge">Badge</LinkTo> components.
- Critical Alerts — For errors or urgent notifications that require immediate user attention, use the <LinkTo id="Molecules/Alert">Alert</LinkTo> component.

## Accessibility considerations

- **Respects Reduced Motion Preferences:** The shimmer effect is automatically disabled if the user has reduced motion enabled. This ensures an accessible experience for users who prefer to minimize animations.
- **Triggers Only When in View:** The shimmer effect activates only when the component enters the viewport. This prevents unnecessary animations and improves performance, especially for screen readers and users navigating via keyboard.
