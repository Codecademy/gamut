## Usage

- Toggles are functionally similar to Checkboxes, as they both display whether they are checked or not.
- Also like our Checkboxes, our Toggles are [controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), so their checked value must be controlled by an external state and onChange.
- Like other Form Elements, make sure to include a label with your Toggle.
  - Labels can be on either side of the Toggle — choose the direction that aligns best with the other elements on the page.
- Toggles are most effective when they trigger an immediate action with related components (like changing copy or showing a section when toggled)

## Size

### Medium

Medium is the default and preferred size, especially if it is part of a form.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.Medium} />

### Small

Use the small size for UI toggles that are outside of a form context and need to fit into smaller areas.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.Small} />

## Disabled

Disabling the input will change the opacity and cursor but still denote the current value.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.Disabled} />
<Canvas of={ToggleStories.DisabledChecked} />

## Labels

Disabling the input will change the opacity and cursor but still denote the current value.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.LabelRight} />
<Canvas of={ToggleStories.LabelLeft} />

Labels can also be React components.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.ReactComponentLabel} />

## HTML element

Our Toggles default to being `input` elements, but can also be the `button` element.

- An `input` toggle should be provided an `onChange` and should have a secondary action (such as a submit button) that does something with its value. It is also usually wrapped in a form.
- A `button` toggle should be provided an `onClick` and have an action that happens immediately (i.e, without a secondary input.) The toggle also gets the `role` of `switch`.

If you use voiceover on either of the below, you will hear the difference this makes for accessibility.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.InputElement} />
<Canvas of={ToggleStories.ButtonElement} />

## Interactive examples

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.InteractiveInputToggle} />
<Canvas of={ToggleStories.InteractiveButtonToggle} />

## Playground

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={ToggleStories.Default} />
