## Adding an Icon

### Designers

1. Identify a need for an icon.
2. Find/request one on [streamline](https://www.streamlinehq.com/) (credentials in 1Password) for the appropriate type (Regular or Mini).
3. Follows the Design guidelines for adding an Icon to the Figma library.
   1. [regular icons](https://scribehow.com/shared/How_to_add_a_regular_size_icon_to_the_Figma_library__89he3MpFQj-7d9CP6AFLQg)
   2. [mini icons](https://scribehow.com/shared/How_to_add_a_mini_size_icon_to_the_Figma_library__mDFi_BuaQ-yHDsufs9tlxQ)
   3. NOTE: If you're blocked from accessing the links, please turn off your VPN temporarily.
4. Handoff the SVG to an engineer (the icon should pull from Streamline).

### Developers

1. Given an Icon SVG from Design or an approved Streamline icon, check whether the Icon is Regular or Mini.
   1. Regular Icons should come from "Ultimate Regular" and have `viewBox="0 0 24 24"` and have `stroke-width= "1.5"`.
   2. Mini Icons should come from "Core Solid" have `viewBox="0 0 16 16"` and have outline.
   3. You should be using the Icon from Streamline, NOT Figma.
2. If it doesn't already have it add the streamline slug (IE: `delete-1`) as the SVG title if it does not already exist and ensure the viewBox is set to `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`. Preserve the source URL, add any relevent comments, and disregard the asset size.
3. Add the SVG asset to the appropriate folder in `packages/gamut-icons/src/svg/` - either [regular](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut/tree/main/packages/gamut-icons) or [mini](https://github.com/Codecademy/gamut/tree/main/packages/gamut-icons/mini).
   1. Regular Icons should follow the naming convention: `<ICON_NAME>Icon.svg`. (e.g. `AddIcon.svg`)
   2. Mini Icons should follow the naming convention: `Mini<ICON_NAME>Icon.svg` (e.g. `MiniStarIcon.svg`).
4. Run `yarn build-all && yarn start` to see the icon add to Storybook.
   1. Regular Icons will by default be added to the `Interface` section alphabetically, however, you may change this in the config. I.e. if you added an icon that should belong in the `Vendor` section, you can make this change in the `constants.tsx` file.
5. Make a PR describing where you got the Icon, what its use is with a description of its naming choice.

### Troubleshooting

1. If the icon is not rendering correctly, check that if the initial asset has a `<mask>` -- if it does, ask the designer to remove it. Gamut will add in a mask during the build process.
