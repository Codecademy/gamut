## Usage

- PopoverContainer is only responsible for positioning its content and does not include any styles for its content.
- Use the `inline` prop to ensure that scrolling and resizing do not result in unnecessary rerenders / jumpy popovers. The popover renders with absolute position relative to the current stacking context.
- Do not use `inline` when the current stacking context is too small or the container is wrapped with an element that specifies `overflow: hidden`.

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const target = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);

  return (
    <Box>
      <Box position="relative">
        <FillButton ref={target} />
        <PopoverContainer inline targetRef={target} alignment="left">
          I render relative to my nearest parent!
        </PopoverContainer>
      </Box>
      <PopoverContainer targetRef={target} alignment="left">
        I render relative to the window!
      </PopoverContainer>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

## Positioning

There are multiple props that can be used to position the popover. Progressively getting more specific:

1. `alignment`: Positions the popover along the edge of the targets dimensions.
2. `invertAxis`: Mirror the content 100% of its dimensions along its inside border on either axis (can only affect multi-directional alignments like `top-left`)
3. `offset`: Adds addition offset in the direction of the `alignment` (e.g. 30 and `top-left` will move the popover 30px to the top and left.
4. `x` + `y`: Offset each axis individually if needed for more surgical control.

### `alignment`

Position the popover at the exact edge of these coordinates.

<Canvas of={PopoverContainerStories.Alignment} />

### `invertAxis`

Flip the popover content along either the x or y axis relative to the alignment. top-left and x would render the popover on the inside left edge rather than outside.

<Canvas of={PopoverContainerStories.InvertAxis} />

### `offset`

Addition pixel offset from center in the direction of the alignment (e.g. top-left and offset 20 results in 20 pixels to the left/top).

<Canvas of={PopoverContainerStories.Offset} />

### Individual axis offsets `x` and `y`

Absolute offset values irrespective of the relative position. (e.g. x={-4} will be 4 pixels to the left in every position unlike offset).

<Canvas of={PopoverContainerStories.XandY} />

### `skipFocusTrap`

When `skipFocusTrap` is set to `true`, the focus trap is disabled and page interaction is allowed. This is useful when the parent component is handling focus management and accessibility.

<Canvas of={PopoverContainerStories.SkipFocusTrap} />
