## Usage

Illustrations are intended to be able to take in props for variants such as color, so despite being SVG-based, they're stored in our code as regular React components and can be used like so:

```jsx
import { NumberBlocks } from '@codecademy/gamut-illustrations';

<NumberBlocks width="128px" />;
```

## Adding an illustration

If you cannot find the Illustration you would like in the ones that we have specified here, please follow these steps to add one.

1. In a Figma that contains an illustration, right-click on the layer and copy it as an SVG
2. Use `svgo`, such as through https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg, to minify that markup
   - Tip: the default settings work _except_ you'll need to add the root `viewport` attribute back to the `<svg>`
3. Paste the SVG in a new component under `packages/gamut-illustrations/src/<IllustrationName>.tsx`
4. Run the ESLint auto-fixer to correct React attribute names
5. Add the illustration under `packages/gamut-illustrations/src/index.ts`
6. Send this in as a `feat` pull request
