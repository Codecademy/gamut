<ComponentHeader {...parameters} />

#### PatternLeft
Setting `shadow = "patternLeft"` will apply a pattern bottom and left sides of the Card. By default, the pattern used is `CheckerDense`, but you can pass in a different pattern using the `pattern` prop.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ShadowPatternLeft} />

## Usage

Use Card to present different types of information in a visually appealing way.

## Variants

### Backgrounds

#### Default
When a Card is not provided a `variant`, i.e. it uses the `'default'` variant and it will use the `'background'` color token â€” this color token is <LinkTo id="Foundations/ColorMode">ColorMode</LinkTo> responsive.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Dynamic} />

#### White, Yellow, and Biege
The `'white'`, `'yellow'`, and `'beige'` variants are used to apply static background colors to the Card. These colors are intended to work when the Card is used inside a "light mode" background.

<Canvas of={CardStories.StaticLight} />

### Navy and Hyper
The `'navy'` and `'hyper'` variants are used to apply static background colors to the Card. These colors are intended to work when the Card is used inside a "dark mode" background.

<Canvas of={CardStories.StaticDark} />

### Shadow
Cards can also take on a `shadow` variant that applies an additional styling to the bottom and left/right sides of the card.


#### None
By default, or when setting `shadow = "none"`, there is no shadow/pattern applied to the card.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ShadowNone} />

#### Outline
Setting `shadow = "outline"` will apply a shadow to the bottom and left sides of the Card that takes on the color and border color of the Card.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ShadowOutline} />



#### PatternRight

<Canvas of={CardStories.Navy} />

### Hyper

<Canvas of={CardStories.Hyper} />

### Beige

<Canvas of={CardStories.Beige} />

## Shadow variants

### Small

<Canvas of={CardStories.PatternLeftShadow} />

### Medium

<Canvas of={CardStories.PatternRightShadow} />

### Outline

The outline color will inherit the color of the card.

## As link

<Canvas of={CardStories.Link} />

## ColorMode as default

Card elements respond to the current <LinkTo id="Foundations/ColorMode">ColorMode</LinkTo> they are used in. Note that their background color will match the background of their context and secondary colors are used for their hover effect. As these are not the typical inverse effects we utilize in color mode, please check with your design team before use.
