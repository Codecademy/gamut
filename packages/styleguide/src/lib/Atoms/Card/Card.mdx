## Usage

Use Card to present different types of information in a visually appealing way.

## Variants

### Backgrounds

#### Default

When a Card's `variant` prop isn't set, or it's set to `'default'` it will use the `'background'` color token â€” this color token is <LinkTo id="Foundations/ColorMode">ColorMode</LinkTo> responsive.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Dynamic} />

#### White, Yellow, and Biege

The `'white'`, `'yellow'`, and `'beige'` variants are used to apply static background colors to the Card. These colors are intended to work when the Card is used inside a "light mode" background.

<Canvas of={CardStories.StaticLight} />

### Navy and Hyper

The `'navy'` and `'hyper'` variants are used to apply static background colors to the Card. These colors are intended to work when the Card is used inside a "dark mode" background.

<Canvas of={CardStories.StaticDark} />

### Shadow

Cards can also take on a `shadow` variant that applies an additional styling to the bottom and left/right sides of the card.

#### None

By default, or when setting `shadow = "none"`, there is no shadow/pattern applied to the card.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ShadowNone} />

#### Outline

Setting `shadow = "outline"` will apply a shadow to the bottom and left sides of the Card that takes on the color and border color of the Card.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ShadowOutline} />

#### PatternLeft

Setting `shadow = "patternLeft"` will apply a pattern bottom and left sides of the Card. By default, the pattern used is `CheckerDense`, but you can pass in a different pattern using the `pattern` prop.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ShadowPatternLeft} />

#### PatternRight

Setting `shadow = "patternRight"` works like `"patternLeft"` but applies the pattern to the bottom and right sides of the Card. You may also change the `pattern` used.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ShadowPatternRight} />

### As a link

Cards can be used as links by providing an `href` prop. These Cards can also accept an `onClick` prop that accepts a function. Stylistically, these Cards will have a hover effect that adds a shadow to the card.
