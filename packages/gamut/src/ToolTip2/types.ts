 * Valid placements are:
 *
 * auto
 * top
 * right
 * bottom
 * left
 *
 * Each placement can have a variation from this list:
 *
 * -start
 * -end
 *
 * Variations are interpreted easily if you think of them as the left to right written languages.
 * Horizontally (top and bottom), start is left and end is right.
 * Vertically (left and right), start is top and end is bottom.
