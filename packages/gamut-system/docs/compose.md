# Composition

There may be instances where you would like to combine properties for ease of sharing or performance to batch their computations. To make this easy we've added a compose function to combine returned style functions into a single one with the intersection of all of their props.

By default system will return a few groups of composed or group functions `typography`, `layout`, `spacing`,`border`, `background`, `color`, `flexbox`,`grid`.

However, we expose a `compose` function to combine any style function as necessary.

```tsx
import { compose } from '@codecademy/gamut-system';
import { fontSize, letterSpacing } from './system';

const myCoolComposed = compose(letterSpacing, fontSize);
```

The prop types of the resulting function will be:

```tsx
type MyCoolComposed = {
  letterSpacing?: <%TYPE>
  fontSize?: <%TYPE>
};
```
