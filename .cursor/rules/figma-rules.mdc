description: Figma Dev Mode MCP rules
globs:
alwaysApply: true
---
  - The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
  - IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided
  - IMPORTANT: Always use components from `/packages` whenever possible
  - Prioritize using semantic tokens and component props over Figma fidelity
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Avoid hardcoded values, use semantic design tokens whenever possible. The Background component is the exception -  use color token names (i.e, navy, white, etc) and not a semantic token
  - IMPORTANT: Do not use inline styles, whenever possible use emotion and the css-in-js utilities from `/packages/gamut-styles`. Follow the rules from `packages/styleguide/src/lib/Foundations/System`
  - IMPORTANT: Follow WCAG requirements for accessibility
  - Always follow best practices from `/packages/styleguide/src/lib/Meta/Best Practices.mdx`
  - IMPORTANT: All patterns should come from `/packages/gamut-patterns` - match the Figma component name to the pattern component
  - IMPORTANT: All icons should come from `/packages/gamut-icons` - match the Figma component name to the icon component
  - Check if the Figma component name matches a Gamut component name and use that component
  - Use the tokens from `packages/gamut-styles/src/variables`
  - Use the CodeConnect implementation

  - Check if the Figma component name matches a Gamut component name and use that component
  - Avoid using the `Box` component, use more specific components whenever possible
  - Use the tokens from `packages/gamut-styles/src/variables`
  - When creating forms, use ConnectedForm from `packages/gamut/src/ConnectedForm` or GridForm from `packages/gamut/src/GridFrom` whenever possible. Documentation for these components is at `packages/styleguide/src/lib/Organisms/ConnectedForm` and `packages/styleguide/src/lib/Organisms/ConnectedForm`
  - When designs are on a dark background, use the `Background` component from `packages/gamut-styles/src/Background.tsx`and follow ColorMode documentation from `packages/styleguide/src/lib/Foundations/ColorMode`
