globs:
alwaysApply: true
---
  - The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
  - IMPORTANT: If the Figma Dev Mode MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly
  - IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload
  - IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided
  - IMPORTANT: Always use components from `/packages` whenever possible
  - Prioritize using semantic tokens and component props over Figma fidelity
  - Avoid hardcoded values, use semantic design tokens from Figma whenever possible
  - Do not use inline styles, use emotion and the css-in-js utilities from `/packages/gamut-styles`
  - Follow WCAG requirements for accessibility
  - Always follow best practices from `/packages/styleguide/src/lib/Meta/Best Practices.mdx`
  - All patterns should come from `/packages/gamut-patterns`
  - All icons should come from `/packages/gamut-icons`
  - Check if the Figma component name matches a Gamut component name and use that component
  - Avoid using the `Box` component, use more specific components whenever possible
  - Use the tokens from `packages/gamut-styles/src/variables`
  - When creating forms, use ConnectedForm from `packages/gamut/src/ConnectedForm` or GridForm from `packages/gamut/src/GridFrom` whenever possible. Documentation for these components is at `packages/styleguide/src/lib/Organisms/ConnectedForm` and `packages/styleguide/src/lib/Organisms/ConnectedForm`
  - When designs are on a dark background, use the `Background` component from `packages/gamut-styles/src/Background.tsx`and follow ColorMode documentation from `packages/styleguide/src/lib/Foundations/ColorMode`
