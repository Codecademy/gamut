# CircleCI to GitHub Actions Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration from CircleCI to GitHub Actions completed on October 21, 2025.

## New GitHub Actions Workflows Created

### 1. `publish-production.yml`

- **Purpose**: Publishes production packages to npm when changes are merged to main
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Key Features**:
  - Skips automated release commits to prevent circular builds
  - Uses Lerna for conventional commit-based versioning
  - Creates GitHub releases automatically
  - Uses concurrency control to prevent simultaneous publish jobs

### 2. `deploy-production.yml`

- **Purpose**: Deploys production Storybook to GitHub Pages when changes are merged to main
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Key Features**:
  - Builds all packages and Storybook
  - Deploys to GitHub Pages using gh-pages
  - Uses concurrency control to prevent simultaneous deploy jobs
  - Skips automated release commits

## Files Modified

### 1. `.github/workflows/automerge.yml`

- **Change**: Updated CircleCI check reference from `build-test` to `test`
- **Reason**: The test suite is now run via GitHub Actions workflow named "Test Suite" with job name "test"

### 2. `README.md`

- **Changes**:
  - Replaced CircleCI badge with GitHub Actions badge
  - Updated publishing documentation to reference GitHub Actions instead of CircleCI

### 3. `nx.json`

- **Change**: Updated `ci` named input to reference GitHub Actions workflows
- **Before**: Referenced `.circleci/config.yml` and `.github/push.yml`
- **After**: References `.github/workflows/**/*.yml` and `.github/actions/**/*.yml`
- **Impact**: Nx will now properly invalidate caches when any GitHub Actions workflow or action changes

## Files Deleted

### 1. `.circleci/` directory

- **Removed**: Entire CircleCI configuration directory
- **Reason**: All workflows have been successfully migrated to GitHub Actions

## Workflow Comparison

| CircleCI Job    | GitHub Actions Workflow              | Status      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `checkout_code` | Integrated into individual workflows | ✅ Migrated |
| `publish`       | `publish-production.yml`             | ✅ Migrated |
| `deploy`        | `deploy-production.yml`              | ✅ Migrated |

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **DRY Principles**

All workflows reuse the existing composite actions in `.github/actions/`:

- `yarn/` - Node.js setup and dependency installation
- `set-git-user/` - Git user configuration
- `set-npm-token/` - NPM authentication
- `skip-automated-commits/` - Skip release commits
- `validate-pr-context/` - Ensure PR context exists

### 2. **Concurrency Control**

Replaced CircleCI's queue orb with GitHub Actions concurrency groups:

- `publish-production` - Ensures only one publish runs at a time
- `deploy-production` - Ensures only one deploy runs at a time
- Both set `cancel-in-progress: false` to avoid canceling active deployments

### 3. **Consistent Patterns**

Followed patterns established in existing workflows:

- Same Node.js version (`22.13.1`)
- Same runner (`ubuntu-22.04`)
- Same environment variables
- Same timeout settings (30 minutes)
- Same permissions structure

### 4. **Security Best Practices**

- Minimal permissions using principle of least privilege
- Separate tokens for different purposes (`ACTIONS_GITHUB_TOKEN` vs `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`)
- Explicit permission declarations for each workflow

## Testing Checklist

Before considering this migration complete, verify:

- [ ] Merge a PR to main and confirm packages are published correctly
- [ ] Verify GitHub releases are created with proper changelog
- [ ] Confirm Storybook deploys to GitHub Pages successfully
- [ ] Check that automerge still works with the new test check name
- [ ] Verify concurrency controls prevent overlapping publishes/deploys
- [ ] Ensure skip-automated-commits properly prevents circular builds

## Secrets Required

Ensure the following secrets are configured in GitHub:

- `ACTIONS_GITHUB_TOKEN` - For creating releases and pushing to gh-pages
- `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` - For publishing to npm
- Other existing secrets used by other workflows

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can temporarily:

1. Restore `.circleci/config.yml` from git history
2. Re-enable CircleCI in the repository settings
3. Update the automerge workflow to reference `build-test` again

However, this should only be done as a last resort. Most issues can be fixed by updating the new workflows.
