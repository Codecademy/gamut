## The 4 principles of accessibility

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the Internet's main international standards organization. W3C maintains a set of guidelines for web accessibility. The most up-to-date version of W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines is [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines contain 4 principles for creating accessible content. Understanding these 4 principles is key to understanding how to write accessible content.

### 1. Perceivable

Information on-screen must be perceivable to blind, deaf, low-vision, or color-blind learners.

- Include meaningful and unique alt text for all non-decorative images or icons
- Don't rely on visuals for words to make sense
- If text is meant to be read, include it as text and not an image
- Include captions for video and audio content

### 2. Operable

Content should be easy for users to navigate and find what they're looking for. Touch and click targets should be easy to hit and content should be accessible with a screen reader.

- Make hyperlink text long enough that it's easy to hover over and click
- Use meaningful, unique, and descriptive CTAs
- Avoid ambiguous link text like "Click here" or "Read more"
- If more than one label contains the same text, clarify with screen-reader-only text
- Write so that labels, tooltips, and input fields appear in a logical order
- Avoid directional language like "above" or "below"
- Ensure users have enough time to read text

### 3. Understandable

Content should be easy to understand. Plus, it should appear and operate in predictable ways.

- Use H1, H2, H3 headings correctly and consistently ([Learn more about headings](https://www.notion.so/Headings-be907c4d24c84dffb970cedc3ee54936))
- Check to ensure copy is at a 7th-grade reading level or below
- Use short, clear sentences and paragraphs
- Avoid jargon, slang, and idioms
- Expand acronyms on first use
- Use list formatting when appropriate

### 4. Robust

- Write in a way that's platform-agnostic (i.e. select or choose vs. tap or click)

### Bonus: Meaningful

You'll find the word "meaningful" used a lot in guidance for writing for accessibility. So we're taking the opportunity to throw in a quick definition of what we mean when we use it.

Meaningful text is useful text. It provides the full context a user needs to understand a situation.

Meaningful alt text describes what's important about an image a user can't see. Meaningful button text clearly where a link will go. It avoids ambiguous standalone phrases like "click here" or "read more."
