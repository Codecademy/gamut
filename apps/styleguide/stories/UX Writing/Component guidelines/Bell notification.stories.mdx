Bell notifications let us share CTAs relevant to a learner’s personal experience. This includes things like changes to a course a learner is taking, responses to a forum post they wrote, or other calls to action that support their learning journey.

## Best practices

- **Notifications are personal.** Bell notifications should be used to surface calls to action that are relevant to a learner’s personal experience.
- **Notifications support focused learning.** Bell notifications should notify learners about information in support of their learning journey. They should not be a deterrent or distractor to that learning. The messaging should be relevant to the interactions, content, goals, and interests of the individual learner.
- **Notifications are actionable.** All notifications should have a personalized, clickable action. Use a bell notification only when there is a relevant action to take. Otherwise, opt for a different communication channel.
- **Notifications are brief messages.** Notifications should be no longer than 86 characters (max. 3 lines). Unless otherwise specified — or directly removed by the learner — a notification should disappear after 30 days.
